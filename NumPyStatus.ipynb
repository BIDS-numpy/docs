    "\n",
    "There have been many bug fixes and improvements to NumPy. Some of the notable highlights have been:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operations like a + b + c will reuse temporaries on some platforms\n",
    "- Inplace operations check if inputs overlap outputs and create temporaries\n",
    "- The text io functions now handle files with any Python supported encoding.\n",
    "- There are major improvements to printing of NumPy arrays and scalars.\n",
    "- The new `__array_ufunc__` protocol allows overriding ufuncs.\n",
    "- The new np.block function for creating blocked arrays.\n",
    "- The np.einsum function uses BLAS when possible\n",
    "- NumPy switched to pytest for testing."

    "- NEP-0018: Support for an `__array_function__` protocol to facilitate overriding a larger class of numpy functions than allowed by `__array_ufunc__`\n",
    "- NEP-0019: Support for new random number generators and algorithms. This will require dropping the guarantee on repeatable random number streams, but the old routines will be maintained for backward compatibility.\n",
