# Feedback: One day NumPy/SciPy seminar at MSRI

## Summary

1. Intersperse exercises with the material, and devote more time to
   them.
2. Provide reading material to improve odds that all students are on a
   similar level.
3. Students loved having access to the materials and Jupyter notebooks
   with solutions.
4. TA'ing was helpful.

Note to ourselves: pair up students for exercises.

## Submitted comments

---

- I really enjoyed the class
- It was well organized and

Thank you

---

- It is such a well-organized summerschool.
- Keep it as it is.  Appreciate it.

---

- Can make it a bit more exercise based and a bit less explanatory.
- But overall it was a great lecture.

---

I think more time should have been dedicated to Sparse matrices on
Numpy instead of Matplotlib.  That's because this was a workshop
related to compressed sensing.

---

- Liked that we had notes and solutions for the problems.
- Maybe a little more enthusiasm next time.

---

I liked the different exercises which were very useful to better
understand the concept.
Using Jupyter is great and instructive.
I would suggest to give more exercises, and "talk" less, specially
about the Voronoi topic.

---

Like: Exercises + information
Improve: More exercises while teaching to improve engagement

---

- The files were very well-organized and it was so easy to access them
- It was easy for us to follow with the speakers because of the
  prepared files
- The exercises were *very* interesting and challenging
- The pace was great for beginners
- I would've preferred to do/apply the commands while they were being
  introduced but time didn't allow for this, which is completely fine
  since we can do that later on our own!

Thank you so much!! Much appreciated!

I like everything, especially the homework exercise.

and I found the "TA" are very helpful when I rise my hand to ask for
questions.

---

I really liked how well documented & easy to follow the files were.
They will be a good resource for future use.

Maybe include more exercise-like questions throughout the documents so
that the reader/student can practice more as the lecture progresses
instead of all at the end.

---

Thanks for coming:

Liked: I've never worked in python.  Thanks for the introduction and
all the documents and exercises.

Could be improved: I would have preferred to just work on exercises
the whole day and used the notebooks for reference.  I didn't get much
from the presentations, they were too fast for me.

---

Pros:

- hands-on exercises
- good explanations
- friendly interaction

Cons?:

- More background info before going into details
- Say a little bit about the syntax (mayb be easy to people from
  Matlab)
- go a little bit slow sometimes (probably it is my prob since I am
  not so familiar with this language)

Good job! Thanks!

---

Pro:

(1) I really like the course content is posted on Github which is easy
to check the update and subscribe.

(2) The Jupyternote is also a good choice for teaching and practice.

(3) The examples and exercises are clear and interesting.

Con:

(1) There are two different levels people who have already known
numpy, pandas... and who are the first time to use Python.  Maybe next
time we can have some pre-reading materials to decrease this gap and
be familiar with the content.

---

You guys did a good job.  I enjoyed a lot.  But it would be better if
you could

1. hand out materials in advance, so people who are not familiar with
   Python may study earlier.
2. give more examples in demonstration.

Thanks for your wonderful lectures!

---

Next time, I hope you can slow down a little bit.  As a new learner, I
feel hard to follow all the codes and packages.  Meanwhile, I think
give materials before the class will also be helpful.

---

I think for the most parts of course, it is easy to catch up.
However, for the image part, usually with a big chunk of codes, it's a
little bit hard.
And my recommendations (for the beginner like me) are:
1) List several classif books about Python of useful links
2) Maybe more examples would be better.

---

Requests:

- more exercises in the middle of lectures
- tyler can please speak a bit more to the audience. we like to learn from
  his knowledge

---

Thank you guys for this lesson.  I code a lot lasst months, so this
day was most productive for me so far.  I got good recommendations on
how to make my code faster, thank you Stefan.

Best wishes,

Things I liked: Fairly simple and straight to the point.  Liked
interactions during lecture (in-lecture exercises)

Things I did not like: Unexplained notations

---

Like:

- All codes and materials are provided
- Instructors are friendly & helpful
- Helpful information

Don't like:

- The exercises are a little too hard for beginners.

---

The lectures were a little too basic for me (esoecially the intro to
Python), and it was probably a little too fast for those who haven't
used Python before.  It would be better if we were divided into groups
(if logistically possible):
1. Never used Python before
2. Used Python but not numpy
3. Used both Python and numpy

The exercises were great!

---

Things we liked

- thank you for all the code examples.  I always like having a good
  example.
- The fourier transforms package is helpful to me.
- the imaging example
- we enjoyed jupyter.

Things we might change

- the intro could be shorter (depends on audience I'm sure)
- please explain the background of the Voronoi example, we were
  unfamiliar with this concept
- perhaps more time to let us just play with the code and walk around
  to answer questions.
