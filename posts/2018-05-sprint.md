Numpy Sprint was held at May 24-25 at BIDS
==========================================

About 10 NumPy people met at BIDS over the two day sprint. 

In light of the recent hire of full time [NumPy developers at
BIDS](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/bids-receives-sloan-foundation-grant-contribute-numpy-development), it was felt the balance between the volunteers and the paid workers could lead to a tilt in the priorities of the
project. To migigate this risk, we began work on a roadmap for NumPy that will be approved by a community consensus. Discussion of the roadmap will continue at the upcoming [SciPy](https://scipy2018.scipy.org) conference in Austin.

We worked on a proposal that became a [NumPy Enahncement Proposal](http://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html) to allow consumers of NumPy like DASK and cupy to override numpy function calls,
much like the successfull __array_ufunc__ protocol already in place.

Taking advantage of the level of the developers in the room, we discussed a number of complicated issues and pull requests, making progress on many of them.

In addition, we discussed ways to extend the community of NumPy developers, from getting industry to donate developer time to
clarifying what is needed for a pull request.

The sprint was a wonderful opportunity for me to meet many of the people I have been interacting with on-line, and I look forward to repeating the success at SciPy in early July in Austin, TX
