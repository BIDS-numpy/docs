**Present:** Tyler, Stefan, Matti, Chuck, Ralf

## Follow-up from last meeting

- Hameer is contacting Marten & Stephan and write up a draft NEP for clarifying the asarray/asanyarray and matrix/subclass path forward.
- Matti was going to submit a PR to unify the public opaque `PyArrayObject` with the "hidden" complete `PyArrayObject_fields`. In the mean time the cython people replied with positive feedback about improving cython to allow the newer hidden API, so that PR is on hold.
- Alan wrote a [design document](https://gist.github.com/ahaldane/6cd44886efb449f9c8d5ea012747323b) for structured arrays. We should continue discussing this, especially decided whether to push it for 1.16
  - Conclusion: we will try to fix the save/load issue. Chuck points out that there may be versioning we can utilze for backward compatibility `lib/format`
- Stefan wrote a mail proposing dates for a dev meeting during November. [Trello card]((https://trello.com/c/u3l4Py52))
  - Conclusion: Fri Nov 30 - Sat Dec 1. Stefan will move it forward.
- OpenBLAS is not thread safe? [Issue 11046](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11046). There is a gist to provide an api for determining which blas/lapack implementation is being used at runtime, and to set the number of threads. Sebastian opened an [OpenBlas issue](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/1844) which led to a [PR](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/1852) to fix that particular issue.
  - Conclusion: We should track the OpenBLAS issue and once they release we should update. Also we should try to fix [issue 11826](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11826)

## TODOs from the previous meeting(s) (also see Trello cards)

- We should have a written process for closing abandoned PRs
  - write small NEP?
  - Time from last comment, last change
  - Importance,
  - Add to query page
- [Random number tracking issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11587)
    - Sent email to Robert/Kevin, no response so far; but looks like there is movement in the repo, at least.  We'll keep monitoring.

## Community Suggested Topics

- Who will maintain 2.7-compatibility once it is deprecated?
    - We can offer that once we go 3-only; incentive should then be obvious to those who care.

## Roadblocks

- Merge of umath / multiarray â€” PR is [waiting for merge](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11916)

## Work status

Matti:

- Data-type exploration, refining [tentative plan](https://hackmd.io/cVdS9UyBRayZF-tIW1lC0g?both). The recent discussion on subclassing seems to validate the approach.
- Worked on adding our own numpy.pxd and issues around API deprecation
    - Ralf suggests adding visibility to API work by adding it to roadmap

Tyler:
- see github for various CI-related things
- doctest effort now using refguide_check crudely ported in to NumPy with submodule name changes, etc. ; eventual interest in ecosystem-level refguide package?
    - We will review whether we can generalize NumPy version by January 15th 2019, to potentially build & publish a package
- helping to drive SciPy 1.2.x release process
- Azure works well for NumPy; Tyler will switch SciPy as well (currently runs 2 hrs!)
