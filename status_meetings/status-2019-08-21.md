# 2019-08-21 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Sebastian Berg, Matti Picus, Warren Weckesser, Ralf Gommers, Kriti Singh, St√©fan van der Walt, Matthew Brett, Chuck Harris, Tyler, Anne

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- GSoD update - for general knowlege
  - [2019-08-13 GSoD kickoff meeting](https://hackmd.io/oB_boakvRqKR-_2jRV-Qjg)
  - [2019-08-17 NumPy Web Team Meeting](https://hackmd.io/XzSU7paGQCihOez5HZkFVQ)

- [nep 29 - dropping python versions](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14086)
    - is merged, can be proposed for acceptance soon

- Monitoring of issues / PRs
  - **TODO** Remove difficulty labels, tag easy ones with `good first issue` which is recognized by GitHub UI (`good first issue` exists. The Intermediate one is renamed to `defunc` but still labels quite a few issues)


# Topics

- [Multibuild](https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild)
  - Matthew Brett dialed in to give us an overview of multibuild, and to discuss where it should be hosted.
  - [Test container](https://github.com/matthew-brett/trusty); these are downloaded from Docker Hub during actual usage
  - Best option so far (if it works): change the name of MacPython and move multibuild there, move the numpy wheel building under the numpy organization
    - _From GitHub: ‚ÄúAfter changing your organization's name, your old organization name becomes available for someone else to claim. When you change your organization's name, most references to your repositories under the old organization name automatically change to the new name. However, some links to your profile won't automatically redirect.‚Äù_ https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-an-organization#what-happens-when-i-change-my-organizations-name
  - Also: perhaps move the builds to Azure from Appveyor

- moving some/all of multibuild repos to the numpy organization
  Matthew Brett may join the meeting. He has been maintaining the code to build and test wheels under his [personal github](https://github.com/matthew-brett?tab=repositories). Some of the code needs an update and there are open PRs waiting to be merged.
  - which repos should the scientific stack people take responsibility for?
  - who would be on the team to maintain it?
  - Produce some documentation how it all fits together
    - docker containers: one to build (mutlilinux under the PyPA organiziation) and one to test (managed by Matthew today)

- 1.17.1 release: Chuck will do it this weekend.

- Pinning dependencies. Once again pytest released a new version which broke our tests. Perhaps we should pin all dependencies and use a service like [pyup.io](https://pyup.io/) to automatically issue a periodic PR to update dependencies? Maybe overkill, since pytest, pytz, and cython are our only python build dependencies?
    - Example: [skimage requirements files](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/tree/master/requirements)
    - add a ci-tests-requirements.txt and use it in the CI system.
        - add setuptools also 

- finding a champion for the `financial` module. Is there a way to locate a content expert who can give high-level advice?
    - Push forward discussion on [gh-2880](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2880)
    - Per-function statistics on how often NumPy functions are used: https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/python-api-inspect (see also `data/csv/numpy_summary*.txt`).

- NumFOCUS Summit 2-3 Nov & PyData NYC 4-6 Nov
    - Topic: *"securing funding and navigating the challenges of project governance and leadership"*
    - Possible sprint on the 4th.
    - Ralf to send email to list today
- Next funding opportunity / grant proposal to write (deadline 12 Nov, NSF - writing to start soon)
- Possible NumPy developer weekend: Nov 22-23 maybe move it back to the weekdays before that? Some of the documentation team may join.

## Additional Details

- Matti
  - Thinking about significant projects to take on.
    - üëâ Finishing [cython `@property` decorator](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2640#issuecomment-455276524), initial version was merged in January but it is not complete enough to actually use in the general case
    - do we want to support subinterpreters? There are [open issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+subinterpreter). Would require (at least) refactoring all the global "static" variables into a C struct that can be released.
        - This has been under discussion for many years; not certain where it is going.
    - upgrading to a newer sphinx
      - probably a student could do this (indeed, should be straightforward)
  - help work out the problems in [building and testing python3.8b3 wheels] 
  - reviving dtype allocation and initialization changes in preparation for Sebastian's larger refactoring
  - preparing a [talk](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/blob/scipy-europe-2019/presentations/inside_numpy_talk_scipy2019.pptx) for EuroSciPy Sept 5 based on Ralf's Scipy talk.

- Sebastian
    - Some f2py fixup
    - The dtype refactoring seems to be converging in my head: Place figuring and adjusting of dtypes into a CastingImpl (which is a UfuncImpl). Add information to CastingImpl for chaining. One ugly corner case: "adjusting dtypes" may want to inspect the values in odd cases, such as strings/categoricals)
    - Will update design documents this week: [Extensible Datatypes for NumPy](https://hackmd.io/kxuh15QGSjueEKft5SaMug), [New Datatype dependent UFunc Dispatching](https://hackmd.io/y7ghitUtRQaMyaHFGe-ueQ)

- Warren
    - Review stale PRs, push for close or complete.
    - Review old issues, close where possible.
    - Finish my PR for the multivariate hypergeometric distribution.
    - Catch up on Sebastian's NEP / dtype work
    - Identify project to work on over next few months
