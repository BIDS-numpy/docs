# 2019-1-30 BIDS/NumPy Development Meeting


- Join via Zoom at [https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438), or dial-in through a [local phone number](https://zoom.us/u/adQDmEc1wI).
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [NumPy at BIDS Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2lla2dwaWdtMjMyamJobGRzZmIyYzJqODFjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)

**Present:** Tyler, Matti, Sasha (Intel), Stefan, Chuck, Hameer (Quansight)

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
- [timsort sort](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12418/)
    - Should add to ASV benchmarks [Hameer will take this on] -- see `setup_cache` for saving time on setups maybe: https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing_benchmarks.html#setup-and-teardown-functions
    - Need to extend the benchmark suite for the explicit sorting names
  - Conclusion: in it goes!

- Discuss web hosting situation with NumPy steering council to verify the decision to push github pages [St√©fan]
  - The best way to do this would be to automate circleci for (maintainence-1.16.x, tag) builds to upload documents appropriately. Is it possible? I (mattip) couldn't work out how to run circleci locally.
- [sphinx warnings](https://circleci.com/gh/numpy/numpy/5751?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link) for subclasses of ndarray while collecting autosummary (about half way down the `build devdocs` tab): numpydocs had no reaction to the [issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc/issues/199)  (mattip)
- We still seeing issues with sporadic i386 failures, bisected to the addition of pocketfft and c99 (could we explore bumping the gcc compiler toolchain version for our wheel builds / openblas as well?); need caution for gfortran version I think? (chuck)
  - we could try opening a PR to bump this for openblas builds and see what goes wrong I suppose; I think Mac is a little awkard if you try to bump the toolchain; remember that other OS projects use MacPython system too, so check with them probably?
  - we're only pinning Windows for 32-bit for dev testing; gcc 8.x mingw toolchain seems ok for 64-bit Win, and even allows DLL OpenBLAS version detection (though can't build NumPy off the DLL just yet)
  - Can we reproduce in a stand-alone docker (so far, no)? Perhaps then there is a way to check the floating-point registers that control the accuracy???
      - After reproduction: Change compiler, BLAS, roll back pocketfft

## Community Suggested Topics

- Tutorial on wrapping C for SciPy? (mattip)~
- Stefan wants to do intermediate to advanced NumPy tutorial at SciPy (we haven't had such a tutorial there since, maybe, 2009?); we can divide the workload of writing the material and presenting
- Problem compiling on windows with python 2.7 (Oleksandr): somehow concatenating the args together to a str makes it work properly. Issue is on the way.


## Work status

Matti:
- Workarounds for 1.16 problems.
  - Try to get debian to fix their pip  (Julian Taylor?)
- Dtype work has stalled, waiting for reactions to the NEP (Martin, Eric?).

Tyler:
- working on SciPy manuscript -- see [checklist](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-articles/issues/65) [28/73]
  - now letting others make changes as they see fit to reduce likelihood of making PRs without consensus for change
- OpenBLAS version detection via DLL looking a little better on Windows
  - Consider taking the scripts used to build the openblas libraries out into a submodule
