# 2019-4-24 NumPy Development Meeting

- Join via Zoom at [https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438), or dial-in through a [local phone number](https://zoom.us/u/adQDmEc1wI).
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Tyler, Chuck, Stefan, Hameer, Ralf, Sasha (Intel), Julian Taylor

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions

- Pull request policy now part of a [merged PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13367) based on scikit-image. Since it came up in the discussion, for what it's worth (not much) NumPy's [pulse](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulse/monthly) seems to have about 3 times the activity of scikit-image's [pulse](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pulse/monthly), even though NumPy currently has more resources available to it. 
  
  Need to check that current documentation now adequately addresses the points raised last week:
  - Policy: any committer can merge after a single review, if the PR is judged not to be controversial (rgommers); use normal merge (not squash) to keep committer history if it has a reasonable history, but if it's a noisy commit history, squash.

## Topics

- IBM's bounty for VSX SIMD additions. How does it work, and our expectations.
    - We want to make sure that this is not just a patch that implements the functionality by duplicating existing code. Must be maintainable.
    - Ask Julian if he's willing to summarize a plan.
    - Intel's compiler generates intrinsics automatically, so their patches disable our SIMD checks. If this is to be reworked, it would be good if we could provide for this automated possibility.
    - We didn't rely on compiler for floating point code, but compilers have improved since. For the boolean code we may still need to do it by hand.
    - einsum should also be considered for compiler-generated intrinsics?
    - some of the older SIMD code could use refactoring--Julian will try to write his ideas down for guidance (hard to do without NumPy familiarity)

- PRs waiting for decisions

    - [`*_like` and shape](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13046) waiting for Eric's approval
        - Discussion about more optimistic merging of PRs
            - Unfortunately, PRs sometimes exposes weaknesses / previously unconsidered corner cases of the API
            - Why are we spending a lot of time working on, e.g., clipping with nonsensical input values? see here: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12514 & cross-linked clip work

    - [fail doc builds](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13336) if numpy version does not match (with env var override) waiting for more opinions. Ralf feels it will slow down development, Matti is pushing for a better new-user experience. In any case, the changes to use `:=` to allow command line option override are necessary.

    - PR [13368](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13368) and [13207](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13207) improve performance of ufuncs.
      - Do we require benchmarks to be part of the PR?
      - If so, can we modify existing benchmarks (breaks continuity of ASV graphs)?
      - Are we sensitive to the size of the `_multiarray_umath.so`? How do we decide when the optimization is too expensive in runtime size?
        - should we consider build flags to control this bloat? arch specific build targeting?
        - perhaps make a mailing list post--is binary size a major concern for NumPy; threshold of performance improvement for justification?

- `uarray` as part of the solution to NEP-24: Discussion [Hameer]
    - Docs: https://uarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    - Notebooks: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Quansight-Labs/uarray/tree/master/notebooks/
    - potential for usage as context manager to select between high performance & high precision, etc.

## Additional Details

- Tyler's focus:
  - mostly SciPy 1.3.0 release management: reviewing milestone PRs & working on release notes
  - reviewing some NumPy PRs---PyPy3 CI PR now merged
