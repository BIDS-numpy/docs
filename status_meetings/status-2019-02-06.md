# 2019-2-06 BIDS/NumPy Development Meeting


- Join via Zoom at [https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438), or dial-in through a [local phone number](https://zoom.us/u/adQDmEc1wI).
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [NumPy at BIDS Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2lla2dwaWdtMjMyamJobGRzZmIyYzJqODFjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)

**Present:** Stefan, Matti, Hameer, Tyler

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
- timsort and related sorting enhancements?
    - Matti merged timsort, but some caution needed with backwards-compatibility. Proposed action: Need to find a case where this actually matters before dumping too much energy in to it!
    - [NumPy ABI forward compatibility](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5888)
- SciPy 2019 [Conference Submissions](https://hackmd.io/bzbzioNFRIWfEdGCp3pAqQ) -- Deadline extended to Feb. 15th.
  - detailed description section for tutorials can be a fair bit of work
  - Tyler may consider an updated "Mastering `scipy.spatial`" tutorial, but maybe not! These things are really time consuming to do well.

## Community Suggested Topics

- 12889 PR -- allow_pickle changes for security -- Intel obligation to fix (Sasha) -- savez, savez compressed are causing issues though?
  - Intel is likely to leave savez, savez compressed unchanged; 1.16.1 will have behavior difference b/w Intel & release (policies require CVE fix before install), but 1.16.2 should converge back again

## Work status

Matti (at a PyPy sprint all week, so this is really only Thurs, Fri):
- Helping with the 1.16.1 release issues (pickling ndarrays, removing flaky test, help debugging azure pipeline failures)
- Try to unstick dtype progress by writing another [dtype document](https://hackmd.io/ok21UoAQQmOtSVk6keaJhw?both#) thinking maybe github comments is no the forum to manage a discussion. But that didn't work either. Maybe we need to do a "dtype summit" over a weekend to get some of the higher level details discussed to progress could be made? Could it be virtual? I could come to the west coast for that?
  - TODO: Get all the documents together in one place, post it to the dev mailing list with a call to get reactions

Tyler:
- SciPy `1.2.1` -- I've delayed on this too long
- SciPy manuscript moving slowly as usual (55 % checklist items complete as of this morning; some may be eliminated by consensus)
- lots of stuck PRs / issues--generally because they're challenging--a few examples:
  - `int64 //= uint64` [no longer raises](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12927) `TypeError` in NumPy `1.16.1`
    - related to recent `np.datetime64` floordiv enhancements
    - [PR now open](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12940)
  - ctypes / Windows DLL handling for [OpenBLAS version detection](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12790) remains a challenging / very time consuming endeavor 
  - SciPy ConvexHull issues on older Mac / Xcode [reported](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9751) from scikit-image team
    - `libc++` header issues or something else? -- need to uncouple Mac OS version switching from Xcode version switching in the bug reports to start with; not fun to debug
- there's a really cool [`ConvexHull` facet visibility enhancement PR open](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/9721) that I'm reviewing
- I should start splitting up some of my SciPy computational geometry work into smaller PRs, maybe, but question of priorities
