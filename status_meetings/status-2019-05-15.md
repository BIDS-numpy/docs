# 2019-05-15 NumPy Development Meeting

**Present:** Tyler, Sebastian, St√©fan, Julian, Raghuveer, Ralf, Chuck, Matti

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

## Topics

- Update on [developer meeting, May 10/11](https://hackmd.io/OtUbEI_4T06noPYtlLp-4w)
  - maybe send a summary of the API / names to mailing list for new random machinery
- 1.17 release
    - Is the AVX `expf`/`logf` implementation ready for release? [Necessary optimization](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13557) | [Issue (almost solved)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13520), lacking more benchmarks and independent result verification
    - Should have ~month for pre-release testing
- Do following community meetings one hour earlier so that Kriti can join in easier.
  - yes, but will need another Zoom account, or use another service for the call?
- Deprecate/remove value based promotion
    - Removing it would simplify dispatching/promotion rules (simplifying ufunc work)
    - Should we work on a NEP?
    - concerns about "silent problems" with this change.
    - If it is in the way of dtype work, maybe write a NEP in
      any case to discuss this.
- Updating the roadmap (both scope statement and contents)
    - [Scope](https://www.numpy.org/neps/scope.html) says "this is not aspirational". That needs fixing.
    - [Ralf]: would be good to do something similar to SciPy, main topics and more detail separately. I added missing "Performance" topic in my [PyData presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/RalfGommers/the-evolution-of-array-computing-in-python) (see slide 14)
        - Protocols work pretty well, but e.g. `np.asarray` is a problem,
          as may be `np.errstate`, so there is still work to do here.
- Funding opportunities (NASA, Chan-Zuckerberg)
    - Chan-Zuckerberg grant [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/) aimed at foundational packages like us.
- ManyLinux 2010 adoption
- Incompatibility between numpy/scipy FFT
    - SciPy has a much larger array of FFT functions; cannot rely on NumPy, because PocketFFT implementation just went in. So, will create new `scipy.fft` module, leave `scipy.fftpack` in place, and then also use PocketFFT under the hood. Basic `fft` API will be shared between NumPy/SciPy. GSoC student will implement multiple backends.
- 64 bit integer versions of BLAS / LAPACK of interest in Debian?
  - implications for `lapack_lite` fallback?

## Additional Details
