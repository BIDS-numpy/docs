# 2019-4-17 NumPy Development Meeting
**Present:** Ralf, Chuck, Matti, Seb, Hameer, Tyler, Sasha (Intel), Stéfan

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
- Google Season of Docs
  - Proposal [merged to NumFocus](https://github.com/numfocus/gsod/blob/master/2019/NumPy_ideas_list.md)
  - Should I delete the [alternative wiki page](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2019) proposal? (mattip)
- PRs with [approved status](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved) - can we merge them?
  - [unravel_index, ravel_multi_index and empty input](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11684) - who will push the button?
  - [CVE PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12889): decided to warn on save and error on load if the flag is not set **Done**!
    - flags backport candidate **Done**!
- Tyler was tasked (by Stefan) with trying to get Eric's open PR count down: PRs [13311](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13311), [13312](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13312), and [13301](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13301) were merged with some effort; [10741](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/10741) looks imminent; [8662](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/8662) may be moving forward now
  - Last week our notes show his total at 29; this week I'm seeing 32 (12 pm Pacific, April 16) despite almost full devotion to reviewing his PRs on my end, and I think Matti merged some too
  - Thanks for doing this! I don't understand how the number can have gone up by 3 if there are only two open PRs from 2019 though... (Eric); maybe Stefan's script filters on previous numbers--probably better to just use the raw numbers moving forward; what does "previous numbers" mean? It's a quick hack of a script, so could be buggy. Here are the lists: [numbers from last week](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/blob/master/status_meetings/status-2019-04-10.md#most-prs-open-per-developer) | [list from this week](https://hackmd.io/xCXdX_9-TcGGd8t-oi8-cQ) (Stéfan); (looks like reason is because WIP tags got removed; WIP PRs are ignored by the script)
- Finding PRs that need attention
    - [PRs with at least one approval](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Github-Queries)
    - [Common GitHub PR queries](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Github-Queries)

- Pull requests
  - Policy: any committer can merge after a single review, if the PR is judged not to be controversial (rgommers); use normal merge (not squash) to keep committer history if it has a reasonable history, but if it's a noisy commit history, squash.
  - TODO: document existing developer practice in a contributor guide. See, e.g., the [scikit-image core contributor guide](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/core_developer.html).
  - We should be better at prioritizing the PRs and issues we work on
      - Issues that are filed externally vs. internally identified minor problems
      - Chuck encourages more reviewing / merging, rather than adding more code
      - Concern by developers about making direction-setting decisions
      - One thing to do is to close PR, or unblock it by pushing commits if it's a good addition

## Topics

  - [`*_like` and shape](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13046) (seems to need more work?)

- randomgen
  - When do we do a first merge to master?
  - [Comment](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13163#issuecomment-483040375) to a Table comparing the API
  - Deprecated `random_integers`
  - At May meeting we should discuss the API, get Kevin dialed in, and if all good merge. Matti will announce this to the mailing list, after coordinating with Kevin.
      - Two weeks to respond to concerns on PR + review at meeting.
  - Possible weak points in API https://6722-908607-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/home/circleci/repo/doc/build/html/reference/random/parallel.html#independent-streams
  - Are there questions with the [BRNG](https://6722-908607-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/home/circleci/repo/doc/build/html/reference/random/brng/index.html)?

- Donations, NSF proposal (Ralf)
- Deprecating `matrix` - what is the status of sparse-matrix ?
  - PR 8662 suggest an [invasive change](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/8662#discussion_r276089539) to the ufunc mechanism to check for matrix, would be nice to avoid this
