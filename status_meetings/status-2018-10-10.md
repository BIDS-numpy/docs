# Status meeting 2018-10-10


## Cleanups
Try to get open PRs merged
- Support Alpine Linux (musl not glibc)
- `np.unravel_index([])`
- new gufunc signature parsing
- Stephan Hoyer has started looking at a few of Tyler's datetime PRs; there's
  some general performance / infrastructure concerns about bolting on CPython C
  API code to ndarray dispatch; preference for feature addition to ufunc
  machinery
- opened a few more test coverage PRs
- `get_field(type, offset)` was accessing memory outside the array boundaries
- deprecate `np.asscalar` - almost merged (just a not tested, not used wrapper to `a.item()` )

## DevOps / CI
- Azure is doing "ok"--a few issues had to be cleaned up with MacOS f2py
  things; we're basically skipping the really problematic MacOS tests for now,
  but still an improvement because we were basically not testing with macos
  before
- might be useful to have Azure Windows CI jobs that use MinGW to mimic our
  Windows wheel builds

## Docs
- drafted crude version selector based on skimage javascript, but skimage /
  NumPy adoption of this approach don't preserve location in docs; may be
  better to use approach used by CPython docs for "time travelling" on the same
  page
- one other issue is if we're going to proactively rebuild our history with the
  version selector, and also how many issues there will be with base url
  changes over time
