**Present:** Stefan, Matti, Tyler, Hameer, Chuck, Raghuveer, Oleksandr "Sasha" Pavlyk

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions

- Intel upstreaming patches discussion with Intel people
  - Last week Raghuveer from Intel Open Source Technology Center joined us, this week hopefully we will have the NumPy MKL people
  - We get issues reported on our bugtracker that are due to Intel. Would like to mitigate this:
    1. When Intel patches NumPy, that it is in a way that is compatible with NumPy; not extending with functionality that is unknown to us.
    2. We need an address we can refer people to when they want to file Intel bugs.
    3. If you have improved tests and code that we can use, that is not Intel CPU-dependent, we'd love contributions.
    - Feedback: Raghuveer reported it at Intel. Sasha (Intel) is also on the call.
    - Sasha reports:
        - Add two ufuncs: erf, inverse sqrt
            - This has been removed from public API in next release; inv sqrt availability in older gcc std?
        - Add a submodule for initializing MKL (`numpy._mkl_init`). MKL service package is being released; initializer will be moved there.
        - We noted that having a forked version of NumPy would be useful; public advertisement of work that we can diffed against.
        - FFT is modified; mechanism for patching and unpatching that submodule.
        - Not all Intel code is viable for inclusion, but we can use standard PR process to include *some* of it.
  - Should this be discussed with Anaconda? They are the ones distributing the patched NumPy.  Hameer will find out who the packaging contact is for NumPy at Anaconda.

## Community Suggested Topics

- [radix sort](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12586/) is ready, does it need to hit the mailing list one more time?
    - Chuck wants to get timsort in; Hameer reviewed that PR, and apart from some docs, it's ready to go
        - Should add to ASV benchmarks [Hameer will take this on]
    - Chuck would like to see comparison benchmarks
    - Which should be the default sorting algorithm?
        - **CONCLUSION?**
- Discuss web hosting situation with NumPy steering council [St√©fan]

## Work status

Matti:
- Been tracking several 1.16.0 release related issues
- More work on Cython [property attribute for `cdef`
functions](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2640)
- Support for last-minute PRs for 1.16 and fallout around the release
  - [various pip incantations](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12736) are not uninstalling before installing
  - [python from the windows app store](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12667) cannot modify PATH to load OpenBLAS's dll
- [radix sort](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12586/) which seems ready

Tyler:
- working on SciPy manuscript -- see [checklist](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-articles/issues/65)
- [SciPy `1.2.1`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/milestone/38) backport [activity](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/commits/maintenance/1.2.x)
