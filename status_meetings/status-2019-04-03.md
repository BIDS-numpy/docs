**Present:** Tyler, Matti, Ralf, Chuck, Hameer

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
 
## Community Suggested Topics

- Google Season of Docs
  - It is important that we have *high quality* ideas: quality over volume; chances of success not great

## Work status

Matti:
- randomgen
  Kevin did some refactoring which has been merged to the PR. Since I couldn't get the docs to build cleanly I went back to the bashtage/randomgen repo, which [travis](https://travis-ci.org/bashtage/randomgen/jobs/514664628#L2784) builds with 130 warnings about footnotes. But it does not have the toctree warnings I get. Still investigating.

- Outreachy
  The deadline for new applicants has ended. We now have to decide between the candidates, who did some work resolving documentation issues
  
- Cython
  Still working on `@property` for cdef functions

Tyler:

- Code Modernization
  - SciPy
    - [[open PR]](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/9989): replace the usage of the Qhull Cython buffer interface to NumPy arrays with typed memoryviews
      - various reviewer comments about performance---it is not as simple as just replacing the buffers and everything is faster
      - test coverage incomplete & not shown for Cython (or any other source files) for SciPy at the moment
- Testing / DevOps
  - NumPy
    - [[merged PR]](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13217): publish Azure CI test summaries even on failure
      - now properly fixed [in newly-merged PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13253)
    - [[open fork PR]](https://github.com/tylerjereddy/numpy/pull/6): use POWER8 OpenBLAS instead of ATLAS
      - initial `OpenBLAS` [build script](https://github.com/tylerjereddy/openblas-static-gcc/blob/master/power8/build_openblas.sh) succeeds on ppc64le GCC compile farm machine, but not with static linking---I've contacted them about possibility of including `libgfortran.a` built with `-fPIC`
      - currently, the ppc64le Travis CI runs with my prelim OpenBLAS POWER8 binaries error with `/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libopenblas.so when searching for -lopenblas`
        - looks like I'm getting x86_64 arch on my fork for some reason---I think the reason might be related to [Travis `com` / app vs `org`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12688#issuecomment-479613995)?
  - numpy-wheels
    - still trying to get a solid reproduction environment for `Pinv` `generalized_sq_cases` -- I've been doing debug builds on private version of repo with Travis debug mode: 
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/n3ymA2M.png)
      - I can reproduce this way from the debug / interactive mode:
        - `travis_run_before_install`
        - `travis_run_install`
        - `travis_run_script` 
          - however, dissection of this stage into more manual / interactive components has so far completely failed to generate the test failure, even with `pytest-repeat` via: `python3.6 ../numpy/runtests.py -vv -n --mode=full -- -k "Pinv and generalized_sq_cases and not Matrix" --count=100 -x || true`
          - also, 50-minute cap as usual
  - pocketfft tests somehow changing a flag?--Ralf suggests just skipping the test and moving on...
  - [[merged PR]](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/45): all NumPy Linux wheel testing builds were missing gfortran in container that runs final tests, so had > 550 tests skipping (32 & 64-bit); now down to ~75 skips
