**Present:** Matti Picus, Tyler Reddy, Stéfan van der Walt, Sebastian Berg, Hameer Abbasi


## Follow-up from last meeting

- Started [github query page](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Github-Queries) for open PRs
  - Hide the urls behind text descriptions
- `asarray` vs `asanyarray` discussion turned into a discussion of subclassing on the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-October/078842.html). This comment from Ralf has some action items:
  > What I suggested in the call about this issue is that it's not very effective to treat functions like percentile/quantile one by one without an overarching strategy. A way forward could be for someone to **write an overview of which sets of functions now have asanyarray** (and actually work with subclasses), which **ones we can and want to change now**, and which ones we can and **want to change after np.matrix is gone**. Also, some **guidelines for new functions** that we add to numpy would be handy. I suspect we've been adding new functions that use asarray rather than asanyarray, which is probably undesired.
  - The difference between the two: `asarray` will convert to ndarray, `asanyarray` will pass through. The difference was created for `matrix`, and `asarray` is used where it doesn't make sense to use `matrix`.
  - The subclass should be responsible for behaving like a NumPy array.
  - There was a proposal discussed on whether there should be a protocol for signalling whether object wants to be passed through, or converted. (See withdrawn [NEP 16](http://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0016-abstract-array.html), superceded by [NEP 22](http://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0022-ndarray-duck-typing-overview.html)).
      - Hameer will contact Marten & Stephan and write up a draft NEP for clarifying the situation.
- Sent email about [hiding field access behind API](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-October/078888.html) 
    - Part of major overhaul between 1.7 and 1.8; was not deeply discussed
    - Propose reverting the attribute hiding; hopefully will solicit conversation and help us understand the advantages of the current approach better
- SciPy sparse array (not matrix only) - status?
    - SciPy to depend on PyData/Sparse data structure for this?
    - New N-D compressed sparse format needs developing
    - `pydata/sparse` -> `scipy` link: matrix multiplication, dot, tensordot; via csr_matrix file.
        - They use _csparsetools.pyx
        - Agreement between pydata/sparse devs: linear algebra routines should live in SciPy, data structure in pydata/sparse
    - sparse 2D array in SciPy is no longer helpful to `pydata/sparse`; also no other SciPy changes
- work begun on per-module coverage
  - not really -- Tyler has experimented a little with static analysis to find dead code, without much success so far; CPython C API (common C language static analysis tools not designed for Python C API things like PyObject_Function)+ vendored code complications, etc.
- Alan wrote a [design document](https://gist.github.com/ahaldane/6cd44886efb449f9c8d5ea012747323b) for structured arrays. So far there have been no replies to [yesterday's mail](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-October/078897.html) announcing the document
  - Disucss this next week

## TODOs from the previous meeting(s) (also see Trello cards)

- We should have a written process for closing abandoned PRs
  - write small NEP?
  - Time from last comment, last change
  - Importance,
  - Add to query page 
- Matti will be at BIDS in Nov, let's try to [get some developers together during the month](https://trello.com/c/u3l4Py52).
- [Random number tracking issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11587) mail was sent.
- Any reactions from the steering council on PR review? 

## Community Suggested Topics

**Please add further items for discussion here, along with your name**

- OpenBLAS is not thread safe? [Issue xxx](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11046) points to this text in the [OpenBLAS FAQ](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq) "If your application is already multi-threaded, it will conflict with OpenBLAS multi-threading. Thus, you must set OpenBLAS to use single thread..." Searching for [thread safe](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+thread+safe) on the OpenBLAS web site brings up a number of open issues.  
Should we get involved in trying to resolve this?
    - Sebastian will open ticket on OpenBLAS and start a discussion there


## Roadblocks

- Merge of umath / multiarray — PR is [waiting for merge](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11916)
- Matmul, waiting for [another PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11580) to move forward

## Work status

Matti:


- Data-type exploration, refining [tentative plan](https://hackmd.io/cVdS9UyBRayZF-tIW1lC0g?both). The recect discussion on subclassing seems to validate the approach.
- Worked on adding our own numpy.pxd and issues around API deprecation

Tyler:

- Continue working on getting doctests tested to some degree
- Documentation version selector (some aesthetic + testing issues)
- Follow up on ASV hardware / support specification
- Static analysis tool addition to CI (maybe)
- Azure: 32-bit linux & Raspberry Pi (ARM) maybe? see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2018/sprint-142-update#build-on-linuxarm-and-windows-32-bit-platforms)
