## First third of NEP 15 (merging c-extension modules umath/multiarray) was merged

One major PR was merged. There were a few mistakes that could have been detected by building SciPy and AstroPy with the PR, but Chuck fixed them quickly.

Still todo

- Deprecate [`np.set_numeric_ops`](http://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0015-merge-multiarray-umath.html#proposed-changes) and replace it with a private API
- Internal refactoring of C code now that the shared object is compiled as one unit

## Thoughts on data-type work

Talking to people at EuroSciPy, one of the pain points for researchers using Pandas is the incompatibility of Pandas categorical types with np.dtype. They spend effort converting between the two. If we provided a nice, subclassable dtype it would go a long way to making pandas + numpy play nicer. Pandas essentially uses ndarray as a 1d column store, so they don't need structured dtypes.

- I started a task list in another [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/cVdS9UyBRayZF-tIW1lC0g#), based on my summary of all the issues, NEPS, and brainstorming


## Annoying circular reference issue

https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11867. Still hunting down the source. I have a test that proves there is a problem.

## EuroSciPy report

I gave a tutorial and a talk. Feedback was good. 6 people came to the sprints.  Matti will add short section to the report doc.

## NEP 18 - `__array_function__`

Can we move the mailing list [discussion](http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/Proposal-to-accept-NEP-18-array-function-protocol-tt46001.html) forward? 

## Arm V8 on shippable.com

It [seems to work](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11702), Tyler signed up under his name. There should be an official decision to actually adopt this, does the steering council need to make a decision? Tyler will send a message to mailing list just to be safe -- I think we want a NumPy shippable account.

## Documentation of C code

Go look at email from Pauli

## f2py issues

NASA has been complaining. Chuck's been working on fixing those issues. Issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11824
Tyler can go for it
