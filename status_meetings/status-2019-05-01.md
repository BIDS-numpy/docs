## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions


## Topics

- Speeding up triaging
  - "priority:low" label added for issues that are valid but require effort to resolve. Reviewers can ignore these when triaging.
  - PRs that have long comment histories or are unclear: we will edit the first comment with a "Summary" as in [this pr](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8237)
- PRs waiting for decisions
    - [fail doc builds](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13336) still not merged
    - PR [13368](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13368) and [13207](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13207) improve performance of ufuncs.
      - Do we require benchmarks to be part of the PR?
      - If so, can we modify existing benchmarks (breaks continuity of ASV graphs)?
- NumPy / SciPy [move forward](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/) with Google Season of Docs: publicity to attract technical writers?
- Let's follow up with Microsoft (pbora@microsoft.com) re: guiding the Azure CI code coverage product roadmap (see Tyler's related PR below)
- Linear algebra backend discussed
    - BLIS
        - [Supported architectures](https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/docs/HardwareSupport.md)
    - OpenBLAS
        - [Supported hardware](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq#recent_hardware)
    - Replacing OpenBLAS with BLIS may not be a full solution because of LAPACK itself still uses its own BLAS (i.e. the OpenBLAS one even if we also ship BLIS).

## Additional Details
- Tyler Work Summary
  - SciPy
    - `1.3.0` release management
      - PR review & release notes curation
      - SciPy `1.3.0rc1` released April 26/ 2019
    - manuscript
      -   [[merged PR]](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-articles/pull/127) Add citation for black hole project
    - [[merged PR]](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/10111) coverage report stats directly in Azure CI interface + html artifact for download
      - `codecov` was dead for SciPy, caused tons of issues, and Azure CI team has been very responsive to NumPy / SciPy inquiries
      - getting settings right so that others can view the cov results is a little tricky, but working now
  - NumPy
    - reviewing Eric's PRs
      - [[open PR]](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/10723) `np.longdouble(long)` bug
        - several adjustments / fixes here; all tests pass locally now; CI may need 1 test skip/ adjustment on platforms where `np.longdouble==np.double`
        - [[merged PR]](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13443) we now turn missing function prototype into [compiler error](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13437) instead of warning in Travis CI
  - OpenBLAS
    - [[open PR]](https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs/pull/2) provide MacPython ecosystem with wheel builds for latest OpenBLAS stable release, `v0.3.6`, because of fix for downstream Skylake issues reported in NumPy 
      - builds currently fail on Linux only---issue [reported upstream](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2104) & I confirmed that their [proposed patch](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/2105) remedies the issue
      - will need to follow up with NumPy wheels PR to bump OpenBLAS there + same for some of our dev CI
      - Chuck & I can merge OpenBLAS build PRs now, too
      - will probably have to bump OpenBLAS version used by SciPy `1.3.x` & `1.2.1`: may be useful to improve upstream `OpenBLAS` CI & our own CI for future detection of such arch-specific issues
      - do we want to switch to BLIS? Ralf suggests potentially better testing there? arch support? BLIS doesn't support complex numbers yet. Sasha suggests this still isn't a complete solution b/c LAPACK.
        - Summarize the differences between OpenBLAS and Blis
        - Maybe try a build and compare the benchmarks?
