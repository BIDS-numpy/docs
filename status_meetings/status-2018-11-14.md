**Present:** Tyler, Matti, Sebastian, Stephan Hoyer, Hameer, Chuck, Stéfan van der Walt

## Follow-up from last meeting

- There is progress on the asanyarray/asarray front: [it seems to be coalescing around making Matrix and MaskedArray use the modern protocols](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-November/078953.html).
    - One more protocol: "if you want to convert me into a duckarray use ...": ` __as_protocol_array__`, name TBD
    - Discussion is ongoing on the mailing list ([November thread](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-November/078909.html))
    - MaskedArray is a good test case to work through
- A [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12358) to fix the padding field loading should help to make record arrays less buggy. Additionally, Matti submitted a [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12375) to deprecate fields with blank names
    - Should make cut for 1.16
- [Developer meeting at BIDS Nov 30 - Dec 1.](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-November/078976.html)
    - Matti will be around on Sunday as well, if folks want to keep on working
- OpenBLAS is not thread safe? [Issue 11046](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11046). OpenBLAS has fixed the one issue, they may make a 0.3.4 release. How do we incorporate this into NumPy?
  - We should try to find out how Matthew Brett compiles OpenBLAS and update?
  - Should we wait for OpenBLAS to release 0.3.4 before 1.16?
  - We should try to add a test from the issue

## Community Suggested Topics

- Intel apparently manages their own numpy patches, as noted on a [comment to an issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12374#issuecomment-438725645) Probing around in the patches, they add `invsqrt` and `erf` to ufuncs. Is this something we should be doing too? Should we engage with them to merge some of the patches? (Matti)
    - `erf` exists in SciPy; `invsqrt` comes up a lot in graphics calculations, but we don't have it; both are reasonable inclusion candidates, and we should encourage them to contribute it back
    - They're not advertising these functions too loudy, since we haven't received any bug reports.
- Ralf's blog posts on the NumPy Roadmap: [1](https://rgommers.github.io/2018/10/2018-numfocus-summit-a-summary/) [2](https://rgommers.github.io/2018/10/the-making-of-the-numpy-roadmap/) (Stéfan)
    - Should try to publish on the mailig list
- **Please concentrate on the milestone issues until the release is out** (Chuck)
- We're trying to finalize the [last outstanding PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11898) on fixing the NASA f2py issue
    - Would be nice to have done by the time we fork 1.16
    - **If core devs could review** and give their opinions on Eric's last comment in ...

## Roadblocks

- Merge of [ufunc-as-matmul](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12219) waiting on final approval
    - Benchmark results are about the same, although there is a 10–15% variation between runs, so hard to know for sure
        - Others, when running on dedicated machine, have <5% variation
    - Hameer recommends [tuning for benchmarks](https://perf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system.html )
    - Tests currently failing; Matti will fix this right after the meeting.

## Work status

Matti:

- Worked on adding C-level properties to Cython. Submitted [a reworked PR](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2640), waiting for response.
    - Chuck & Matti are still trying to decide whether this is a good idea; but now it is technically feasible.  Should at least be useful for other projects in the future.
- Remove padding fields from record arrays when loading from a file
    - Roundtripping of padded structured arrays now works.
- Pushed matmul-as-ufunc forward
- Started refactoring dtype creation to make dtypes PyTypeObjects not PyObjects, step one in the [dtype change](https://hackmd.io/cVdS9UyBRayZF-tIW1lC0g?both)
    - PR underway, hopefully will not be "change the world". Still experimenting with it.
    - With subclassing, should make it possible to use `issubtype` instead of `np.issubdtype` and `isinstance` instead of `np.issubdtype(x.dtype, dtype)` and so on.

Tyler:
- see github for various CI-related things
- [doctest PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12253) looking more solid -- CI for refguide passes now; some cleanup may be needed, but much more solid now
    - Ignored: whitespace (to some extent), floating point precision up to (`np.allclose`), memory locations not ignored, #random and # may vary effectively skip the check on the result and never end up feeding to vanilla doctest, however the code may get executed -- Stefan notes we may want to make sure that even these random results do have their code executed at least, but Tyler notes that this is probably a subsequent / follow-up effort that would be related to i.e., a separate doctest scientific package or at least after we merge current infrastructure to NumPy
    - looks like `want == got` is assessed before the random markers are checked so there probably is execution even on those human-readable random markers (Tyler)
- helping to drive SciPy 1.2.x release process: tagged 1.2.0rc1 locally -- working on artifacts now
    - Tyler is working through the release instructions, figuring out the builders and anomalies in that process
    - What is pavement still being used for? Very little. May want to get rid of it like NumPy did?
    - Updated notes are *highly valuable*; otherwise the knowledge on how to apply the various tools live only inside the heads of people like Pauli.
      - the main things to update so far are probably `pavement.py` problems with Python 3 & the fact that source distributions aren't raw source but rather processed with Cython, etc. 
- SciPy Azure openblas challenges -- https://github.com/tylerjereddy/scipy/pull/20
  - getting gfortran / mingw to work with openblas in Azure seems a little tricky -- why do macpython wheel builder and SciPy master branch appveyor config use different URLs for openblas? why the manual patching of distutils -- isn't this stuff in NumPy release now?
  - when the openblas stuff is sorted out for SciPy Azure CI, can then port that to NumPy where openblas would be helpful in CI (benefit from each other)
  - [towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/en/actual-freaking-docs/quickstart.html) for release notes handling in the future? Or something else ([Jupyter's tool?](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/tools/update_whatsnew.py)) to streamline this process?
