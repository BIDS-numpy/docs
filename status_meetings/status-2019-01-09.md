**Present:** Matti, Tyler, Stéfan, Sebastian, Raghuveer, Chuck

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
- blog post from dev meeting - draft is [here](https://hackmd.io/yE21K--tTaKzwOF5ZUJLQQ)
- Implementation of random number generation NEP
  - we will organize a community call ~near end of January for higher-bandwith discussion with Kevin et al.
- Intel upstreaming patches discussion
  - Raghuveer from Intel: open source technology center -- improve NumPy performance wrt Intel hardware
      - We get issues reported on our bugtracker that are due to Intel. Would like to mitigate this:
        1. When Intel patches NumPy, that it is in a way that is compatible with NumPy; not extending with functionality that is unknown to us.
        2. We need an address we can refer people to when they want to file Intel bugs.
        3. If you have improved tests and code that we can use, that is not Intel CPU-dependent, we'd love contributions.

    - Intel distribution is by a different group than open source community group
    - Raghuveer has been tasked with open source contributions to NumPy, but may not be well placed to help address this issue.  But he will see if he can get us a good point of contact.

    - Should this be discussed with Anaconda? They are the ones distributing the patched NumPy.  Hameer will find out who the packaging contact is for NumPy at Anaconda.

- Ideas for presentations/tutorials/BOF at SciPy
  - advanced/intermediate NumPy based on material from ASPP, including from [Stéfan](https://github.com/stefanv/teaching/tree/master/2018_aspp_melbourne_numpy), [Pauli](https://python.g-node.org/python-summerschool-2011/numpy.html), [Nicolas](https://github.com/ASPP/ASPP-2018-numpy), and Juan [[exercises](https://github.com/jni/aspp2017-numpy) | [solutions](https://github.com/jni/aspp2017-numpy-solutions)]
  - presentations
    - `__array_ufunc__`, `__array_function__`
    - grant progress update
  - BOF of the NumPy work
    - dtype progress (ad-hoc brainstorming session breakout from sprints last year)
- IBM: [followup](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12688) after call with Indrajit Poddar
  - we'll likely only get Little Endian support on Travis for now?
  - let's try a PR to add ppc64le and ping if it doesn't work?

## Community Suggested Topics
- [Archiconda NumPy feedstock](https://github.com/Archiconda/numpy-feedstock) looks interesting (Tyler)
    - we had previous concerns about "wheel standards" (?) in ARM(v8) ecosystem I think?
- Backlog of PRs waiting for approval (Matti)
  - [PR 11684](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11684)
  - [PR 12428](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12428)
  - ~~[PR 12679](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12679)~~
  - ~~[PR 12684](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12684)~~
- Backlog of PRs waiting for approval (Hameer)
  - [PR 12586](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12586)
- Ralf was asked by NumFOCUS for numpy "highlights of the year" (Sebastian)
  - Let's distill the grant report to a few key points Ralf can use
    - `__array_function__`
    - Dropping Python 2.7
    - Have a roadmap
- GSoC participation (Stéfan)
    - We will probably not invest in the program this year, because of the significant time investment required for potentially little gain.  Also very few projects for NumPy that fit the scope. Complex project that requires a lot of learning before being productive.
- Response to:
  > I'm a product manager in AWS AI team, particularly focusing on Apache MXNet.
  > We are considering how we can make it easier for NumPy users to use deep learning.
  > Can we have a quick chat to get your insight on this?
  - let's do phone call and see what they are doing? we have no idea

## Work status

Matti:
- substantial effort to flesh out the discussion surrounding dtype NEP(s) -- one of the major grant / community objectives
- More work on cython [property attribute for `cdef`
functions](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2640)
- CPython is now available through the windows 10 app store. `pip install --user numpy` is broken. We have [issue 12667](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12667) and I opened a [cpython issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue35688) as well
  - Missing OpenBLAS DLL; how is this even found? It is located in `numpy/.libs` and added to `os.environ['PATH']`, but how is it added at import time?

Tyler:
- working through Marten's [nanfunction reduction wishlist](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12662) so that, e.g., `np.sum(array, where=_nan_mask(array))` becomes possible
- `timedelta64 divmod` [PR is open](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12683), building on previous `remainder` and `floordiv` efforts
- PR to resolve `NaT` sorting bug is [now open](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12658), but there are various discussion points including consistency with `argmin` and so on
- SciPy `1.2.1` will be needed soon-ish (I haven't set a date yet) because of ASCII character-related broken source builds in Python 2.7
- need to get SciPy manuscript refined / ready for author invites & Scientific Reports?
- the [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12523) to add `OpenBLAS` version information to the NumPy Python interface works on a fundamental level, but needs careful consideration for the rest of the ecosystem
    - `distutils` doesn't really "compile itself" independent of other NumPy components; there may be some tricks we can try, but there's no single obvious way to do this (rather a mess of different approaches with tradeoffs)
    - Matti will take a look at the zip file to make sure the DLL is there.
- we may want to prioritize some of my time & effort to `randomgen` and / or `gufunc` migration tasks moving forward? never-ending set of devops issues continue of course (C99 standard things popping up for SciPy & NumPy, perhaps IBM ppc64le in CI soon, and modernizing the wheels builds / adding openblas version checks etc. could also be useful things)
