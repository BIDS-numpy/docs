## Follow-up from last meeting

- [Developer meeting at BIDS Nov 30 - Dec 1.](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-November/078976.html)
    - Matti will be around on Sunday as well, if folks want to keep on working
    - Agenda and topics https://hackmd.io/gFqjPUSvSmm-0gmBDbrTBw#, please help fill this out
- OpenBLAS still has not made a 0.3.4 release which is holding up our 1.16 release.
    - [Ralf] A summary of all release configs (what version of OpenBLAS used on which platforms)for NumPy and SciPy plus a summary of known issues would be very useful. Maybe as a status page on the wiki?
    - Hameer - there are linear algebra failures on MacOS with Accelerate? He should use OpenBLAS
    - TODO: Could we add metadata to the wheels to say what version of OpenBLAS is in there?
- Any further contact with Intel?
    - TODO: Put together contact list
    - TODO: Matti will email Oleksandr (also: Victor Rodriguez?)
- Ralf's blog posts on the NumPy Roadmap: [1](https://rgommers.github.io/2018/10/2018-numfocus-summit-a-summary/) [2](https://rgommers.github.io/2018/10/the-making-of-the-numpy-roadmap/) (Stéfan)
    - Should try to publish on the mailing list
    - [Ralf] first one was posted to numpy-discussion (see [here](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-October/078822.html)). Can post the other one too. Will also look at getting them on Planet SciPy.
- Do we know any web developers who can do Sphinx / ReST / CSS layout, and know the NumPy community quite well? [Stéfan]
    - Would be nice to add a gallery
    - TODO: Advertise on the mailing list

## Community Suggested Topics

- Should NumPy "officially" drop support for `ACCELERATE` like SciPy? [Ralf]
  - It should at least give a warning when linking with it. 
  - It is not tested in our CI; has been broken for a long time.
  - TODO: Investigate whether we can detect whether we are linked to Accelerate.
  - TODO: Propose deprecating/cutting Accelerate on the mailing list.
- SciPy manuscript? [Tyler]
    - merge intro next week maybe?
    - follow Ralf's suggested workflow from there
    - Ralf's suggested steps:
        1. finish up that intro section (Stéfan commits to doing that by Monday)
        2. give people 1 week to look through and get the paper in their heads again / suggest things to keep and cut.
        3. organize a conference call at the end of that one week to discuss major decisions.
        4. assign tasks to remove/edit content (aim to have that done in <1 week)
        5. let one person go through and edit for style (I believe Matt H and/or Tyler volunteered for that already). (1-2 weeks)
        6. Submit in December
- [Flang](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang), noted as a potential way forward for Fortran handling on Windows for SciPy, looks interesting & Tyler notes two National Lab connections -- what do we need to happen there?
    - [Christoph Junghans](https://github.com/junghans) (LANL) is a contributor on the project
    - the Python [spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) library, heavily used in (and developed by) national labs for package management on clusters, supports building with Flang
    - [Ralf] the action is mainly happening on the `conda-forge` repo [PR](https://github.com/conda-forge/scipy-feedstock/pull/78) and [SciPy windows build issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/scipy-feedstock/issues/80). There's some good momentum, probably just monitor for now (unless someone with solid build/compiler expertise wants to jump in).
- Two projects in planning:
    - Acquiring ASV machines
    - NumPy Days 0 (developer training, workshop, conference)
- NumPy weekly wheels are available at http://8b8c47f30575e674b56d-47bd50c35cd79bd838daf386af554a83.r59.cf2.rackcdn.com/

## Roadblocks

## Work status

Matti:
- Pushed matmul-as-ufunc forward. Should be merged soon?  Matti & Eric have been improving this PR.
- Started refactoring dtype creation to make dtypes PyTypeObjects not PyObjects, step one in the [dtype change plan](https://hackmd.io/cVdS9UyBRayZF-tIW1lC0g?both). A refactoring PR is under discussion and an enhancement [WIP](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12462) one was recently opened.
    - Core devs: please give feedback.

Tyler:
- Currently [convinced](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12457) we're using `brew install openblas` for Mac wheel builds, and ignoring `OPENBLAS_VERSION` -- can I confirm on a recent cron job wheel download?
- SciPy PR to add Azure-based Windows CI tests is [now open](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/9542) and all-green on my fork
    - this should substantially increase development agility
    - working 64-bit and 32-bit openblas & cognate mingw installs means I'm now in a strong position to enhance the NumPy Azure CI with i.e., openblas usage and mingw usage where needed 
- SciPy `1.2.0rc1` has been [released](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/releases/tag/v1.2.0rc1) for testing
    - so far (now more..), one [reported issue](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9540) that snuck past both dev and wheels CI
    - I've kept detailed notes of the release effort from first-time release manager perspective; can do a post-mortem doc update for the pain points maybe
