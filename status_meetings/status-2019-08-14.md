# 2019-08-14 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Tyler, Chuck, Thomas Caswell, Warren, Ralf, Inessa, Matti, Zijie Poh, Stéfan, Kriti, Peter Entschev


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Proposal for dropping older Python versions [NEP 29](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14086/files)
    - We need some data (Python 3.5 downloads).  Preliminary analysis at [this repo](https://github.com/matthew-brett/pypi-by-distro).  See results at end of [this notebook](https://github.com/matthew-brett/pypi-by-distro/blob/master/analyze_pypi_downloads.ipynb).
    - Platforms like Raspberry or systems like PyPy
    - Maybe probably target things like Ubuntu LTS?
    - The people involved in the discussion are not those affected by it. (we may force users to Anaconda).
    - NEP could have options: Projects could decide how fast they move.
    - After discussion we reached a recommendation for a minimum of 36 months and/or 2 version of cpython (the longer of the two)

- NumPy Community Survey:
    - Objective: To engage all NumPy stakeholders and the broader Python community in a conversation that will help to guide decision-making around the project.
    - Distribution channels: PyData.org (100k+ members), social media.
    - To encourage participation in the survey perhaps we could offer to share the survey results report with the participants first, before releasing it into public domain.
    - The survey should have up to 50 questions, mainly close-ended to allow easy completion and processing.
    - Inessa is going to send out an announcement about the planned survey via the NumPy mailing list, and create a repo on GitHub to collaborate on this project.
    -  Do we want various languages? Maybe translate the survey itself, but ask for comments in English.


- GSoD kickoff call summary

- Duckarray [NEP](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/neps/nep-0030-duck-array-protocol.rst)
    - Expand the Motivation (potential users) a bit.
    - Some bikeshedding on naming seems inevitable.


# Topics

- Welcoming Warren Weckesser
    - Warren @WarrenWeckesser is joining the BIDS team, will be working full-time on NumPy. Welcome, Warren!
    - GitHub team membership 
- Monitoring of issues / PRs
    - Still a lot of low-hanging triaging fruit; Ralf recently closed 130 on SciPy in a few hours, team did 200 in total. About 75% of issues that haven't been commented on in 3 years could be closed.
    - [Helpful queries on GitHub](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Github-Queries) — feel free to update
        - **DONE** Add a [label](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels) for [question](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/question), [installation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/installation)
        - **TODO** Remove difficulty labels, tag easy ones with `good first issue` which is recognized by GitHub UI

## Additional Details

- Matti
    - We no longer are tied to http://scipy.org, we should always refer to numpy.org and numpy.org/doc

- Sebastian
    - Draft starts (prototyping): https://hackmd.io/kxuh15QGSjueEKft5SaMug, https://hackmd.io/y7ghitUtRQaMyaHFGe-ueQ
    - Towncrier

- Warren
    - Contribute some time to reviewing PRs
    - Catch up on Sebastian's NEP / dtype work
    - Identify project to work on over next few months
