# Weekly Status Aug 19

Matti went back to Israel.

## datetime64

Matti spent quite a while [fixing](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11694) a regression with pickling datetime64 scalars, which turned out to involve creating PEP 3118 buffers from that dtype. While the dtype uses the 'M' character, the buffer used the 'B' (unsigned byte) and shape=(8,), but not consistently. It took quite a few iterations through tests and implementations to work out what we should do. That hopefully is one of the last regressions for 1.15.1. This has now been merged!

## cython

Cython is still using direct access to ndarray attributes from C, not via the `PyArray_XXX` macros. While we cleaned up one use of ndarray.base, it is not clear how to progress, since many code bases use cython code with things like a.shape[0], they should be compiled to PyArray_DIMS(a)[0]. There is a [PR](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2559) but it fails. This is important to move them on to using a post-1.7 API. Matti has a version that works with pandas, scipy. Is it worth the trouble?

## dtypes

- Matti added some [subclassing issues](https://trello.com/c/VmcDapaS/45-adding-custom-dtypes#comment-5b730517263adb5676549d6f) to the Trello card.
- Also found an [issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2899) that NJS wrote before there were NEPS that outlines some of the goals of the dtype process.
- Tyler opened one PR (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11750) related to C calling Python for string parsing components of NumPy (recarrays fields, etc.); performance improvements were tentatively demonstrated but probably not worth the maintenance burden; Tyler closed the PR based on negative feedback; will not pursue enhancing the string parsing component of the dtype system
- Tyler thought it might be interesting / useful if ctypes could be used to do "pure" Python dtype specs, but this seems to be problematic because of CPython-level open issues from Eric and others...

## Arm build
- all unit tests are passing for Python 2.7 & 3.7 for NumPy on ARMv8 / shippable CI platform (tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11702)
- total CI time on ARM is currently 9 minutes, which is sort of "ok"
- from a long-term viability standpoint, we probably want a wheel "generating" workflow for Cython because its binary compilation from source is almost as time consuming as building NumPy itself; Tyler should perhaps pursue a PR with Cython (we currently use a binary that was manually built by a collaborator)

## Testing / gcov
- the C line coverage PR has been merged, but Pauli has noted at least a few C source files aren't included for some reason; Tyler needs to investigate
- Tyler's new asv benchmarks for loadtxt have increased total asv suite run time in Travis by 90 seconds; PR has been merged, but that is a bit of a big slowdown
- Chuck commented that it might be sensible to use some of the NumPy grant to speed up "testing"

## Euro Scipy
Matti will be presenting a [tutorial](https://github.com/mattip/c_from_python) on wrapping c from python and a [15 minute talk](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/blob/master/NumPyStatus.ipynb) on the status of NumPy. The conference is next week. Matti will also give the 15 minute talk at Tel Aviv PyData on Thurs.
