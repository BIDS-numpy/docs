**Present:** Chuck, Stefan, Tyler, Hameer, Matti, Ralf 

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
- Google Season of Docs
  - draft of our proposal on the [wiki](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2019)
 
## Community Suggested Topics

- revisit idea of making `reguide_check` its own package? (Ralf / Tyler)
  - SymPy has [its own solution](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/utilities/runtests.py) for this as well
  - Aaron Meurer & Hameer suggest focusing improvements on [pytest-doctestplus](https://github.com/astropy/pytest-doctestplus)
      - Current features:
          - approximate floating point comparison for doctests that produce floating point results
          - skipping particular classes, methods, and functions when running doctests
          - handling doctests that use remote data in conjunction with the pytest-remotedata plugin
          - optional inclusion of `*.rst` files for doctests (see Setup and Configuration)
      - Missing (compared to refguide-check):
          - Not NumPy-array aware
      - Open to expansion? See https://github.com/astropy/pytest-doctestplus/issues/55

- PRs with [approved status](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved) - can we merge them?
  - [`*_like` and shape](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13046) (seems to need more work)
  - [unravel_index, ravel_multi_index and empty input](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11684)
  - CVE PR: decided to warn on save and error on load if the flag is not set
  - flags backport candidate
- Improving the "donate to NumPy" information on numpy.org (Ralf)
  - Stage 1: describe the curent situation, where do donations go and who decides
  - Stage 2: should we be asking for more money? How? From whom? What would we do with it if we got a significant donation? Maybe all the core developers/steering council should discuss this?
- The way NumPy implements broadcasting when executing operations such as `matrix += vector` on C-contiguous arrays apparently copies data to intermediate buffers more often than necessary before calling vectorized routines (e.g., `sse2_binary_add_FLOAT()`). See also the `gdb` log in [this comment](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/2210#issuecomment-480805965) and the `kcachegrind` visualization in [this comment](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/2210#issuecomment-480817042). There is [some interest](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/pull/2211#discussion_r274025811) in shortcuts around `npyiter_copy_to_buffers()` (Johannes Zeman)

## Work status

Matti:
- randomgen
  - Docs build cleanly.
  - Benchmarks merged.
  - There are a few design decisions still to be made:
    - [namespaces](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13163#issuecomment-481650914) Do the `pyx` files live in numpy.random or in a subdirectory (I prefer the first)?
    - Each instance of RandomGenerator holds a reference to a RNG instance. Do we need convenience functions `gen.state`, `gen.seed` or should users call `gen.brng.state`, `gen.brng.seed` (I prefer the second)?
  - When do we do a first merge to master?
    - look at new keywords and broadcasting (integer generation?[issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/9710))
    - build a table of comparison from the old to new API
  - Deprecated `random_integers`
- Outreachy
  The deadline for new applicants has ended. There is now [a label](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Outreachy+2019%22) for all the leftover PRs. Maybe some of the applicants will continue with them? We cannot report back to the applicants decisions about possible acceptance so the PRs will have to remain frozen until the announcements are made.
  - Do we need to rethink our onboarding documentation?
- Yet another try to get a helpful [error message](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13293/files#diff-77323b9c4fc9275b69dadcf18726fa6eL44) when `numpy.core._umath_multiarray` fails to import
- We will brand these calls going forward as "community calls", removing the BIDS label, with the BIDS updates being folded into other agenda items.

Tyler:

- Testing / DevOps
  - ongoing discussion with Carl: suggested patch related to NumPy on Windows / MKL for WinPython via email---I'm not clear how this relates to the Intel NumPy repository though (both apparently have `_distributor_init.py`)
  - NumPy
    - [open PR:](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13268) skip the problematic pinv unit test that has been plaguing 32-bit Linux NumPy wheels builds for weeks now
      - Still no agreement here! Chuck seems to prefer a tolerance adjustment, but the linked PR for that affects many other test precision vals & isn't targeted to OS / arch yet
    - [merged PR:](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13264) OpenBLAS v0.3.5 now working in ppc64le Travis CI runs [and ARMv8](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13270) Shippable CI runs; avenues for improvement here:
      - static linking of `libgfortran.a` (need -fPIC build; would have to build gcc myself)
      - better match to OpenBLAS build / make flags used on other platforms?
      - don't use my Dropbox link for the tarball downloads!
      - automatic building similar to [openblas-libs](https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs) some day?
  - SciPy
    - [merged PR:](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/10019) Azure CI publishes test results, even if there's a failure; poached upstream from NumPy last week
- Code modernization / Improvement
  - SciPy
    - [Open PR:](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/10020) speed up the `directed_hausdorff()` Cython code
      - ~5x faster at 1000 points, ~4x faster at 100 points, ~3x faster at 10 points---first commit was less impressive (slower on 10 points), but also more conservative on random number machinery interventions
    - [Open PR:](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/9989) I've put the modernization of `qhull.pyx` *on hold* because I need a reasonably-tractable way to line profile the Cython module directly from its location in the SciPy source / build machinery
