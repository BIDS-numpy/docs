**Present:** Tyler, Matti, Stefan


## Follow-up from last meeting

- Priority labels removed


## TODOs from the previous meeting (also see Trello cards)

- We should have a written process for closing abandoned PRs
- Add commonly used GitHub queries for developers to NumPy wiki
  - start a wiki page first?
    - PRs with no comments
    - PRs with no activity in 6 months
    - Add live link to GitHub query
- Adopt a voting convention where thumbs-up means this is important
    - (S: this was a tentative suggestion; will this be helpful? Let's discuss a bit more.)
    - Wait on this one till we have some queries that might indicate the need for voting
- [Record field access](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11530) as-tuple or as-dictionary: [Allan] Write up NEP / decision description document, we can help as necessary.
  - History: in 1.7 behavior changed to name-name assignment, but with many cases of undefined behavior. In 1.13 changed back to tuple-unpacking assignment.
  - CONSENSUS: comparison with pandas behavior as useful justification? Tuple assignment preferred over field name based assignment. 
- `asarray` vs. `asanyarray` mailing list discussion brought up the `matrix` class. How to resolve? Delegate to `__array_function__` ?


## Community Suggested Topics

**Please add further items for discussion here, along with your name**

- Attribute-hiding APIs (ndarray.data, ndarray.dims) and Cython. In NumPy 1.8 we moved `PyArrayObject`-> `PyArrayObject_fields`, and hid direct access of the `data`, `dimension` and `strides` fields behind functions. Cython does not have the concept of a C property, i.e. writing in Cython `a.data` will either turn into `__pyx_a->data` if the underlying C struct has a `data` field, or `PyObject_GetAttrString(__pyx, "data")` if the underlying C struct does not have a `data` field. In [Cython PR](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2640) an attempt was made to add a third option - mapping python-level attributes to C "getter" functions. That PR has stalled since it turns out to be hard. Should we continue with this or revert our data hiding in NumPy? (Matti)
  - Conclusion: Matti will write a mail asking for why we try to hide the data pointer. 
- SciPy's sparse matrix: providing an array API (will simplify entire codebases, such as scikit-learn, pydata/sparse) (Stéfan)
  - new feature to go into SciPy sparse submodule?
  - pydata/sparse is using matrix from SciPy and then hacking internally to make nd work
  - check Hameer's paper in SciPy proceedings?
  - Tyler should look into this for a few hours this week..

- for testing coverage, it may be of interest to somehow parse the per-module % and flag potential low-coverage issues in the CI?

- Matti will be at BIDS in Nov, let's try to [get some developers together during the month](https://trello.com/c/u3l4Py52).

## Roadblocks

- [Random number tracking issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11587) The [NEP](http://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0019-rng-policy.html) was accepted. There are a number of PRs and issues around [numpy.random](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20numpy.random). Should we be pushing this forward?
    - Activity in repo: https://github.com/bashtage/randomgen
    - Stéfan will reach out to Robert & Kevin to see if we can help
- Reviewer-to-BIDS-dev ratio is starting to strain resources
  There are ~30 PRs from Tyler and Matti, even if half are still WIP that leaves 15 waiting for review, comments.
  - Stéfan will mail steering council for discussion.

## Work status

Matti:

- Merge of umath / multiarray—PR is [waiting for merge](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11916)
- Matmul, waiting for [another PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11580) to move forward
- Data-type exploration, refining [tentative plan](https://hackmd.io/cVdS9UyBRayZF-tIW1lC0g?both)

Tyler:

- Continue working on getting doctests tested to some degree
- Investigating situation with scipy sparse arrays
- Documentation version selector (some aesthetic + testing issues)
- Follow up on ASV hardware / support specification
