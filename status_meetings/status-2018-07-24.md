# 2019-07-24 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Stéfan, Sebastian, Inessa, Ralf, Tyler, Hameer, Zijie, Kriti


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions


- [Issue 13707](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13707) towncrier/pyproject?
- Redo project organization, spell out more roles we have. See PR [gh-14027](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14027).
    - Create slack channel or similar (Ralf)
- Website redesign NEP - translations.
    - Main website only; even upper level docs boils down to 100s of pages
    - Language selection will be manual
    - Translators should not need to work on github directly.
    - Prominently noting contributors, historical and present (note for website redesign)
    - History of NumPy
        - [SciPy paper](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-articles/tree/master/scipy-1.0) may be a good start on which we can expand


# Topics

- Revert `__array__` coercion changes? [Issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13958)
    - Objects iterating inconsistent to ndarray are broken.
    - Should we prioritize `dtype=object` coercsion deprecation?
- Necessary wrap up for 1.17.0 release?
    - Two outstanding issues before rc2—or release?: exponent speed improvements dropping denormals (?), `__array__`, and small test issue 
- Proposal for dropping older Python versions [NEP 29](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14086/files)
- Community building/website
    - We have a small webteam, and others are welcome to join. Current team: Inessa, Ralf, ... <---
    - Follow the [planning PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14032)
- Documentation effort
    - Separation of high-level documentation from numpy source repo
    - Allow more control for team, more dynamic development
    - Should figure out mechanism to roll this into NumPy docs; perhaps hosted subdirectory on numpy.org, or pull in as submodule during docs build
- Conversation with GitHub about mechanism for monitoring community health, improve project planning, etc.

## Additional Details

- Matti
    -  On Vacation

- Sebastian
    - ([pytest-leaks](https://github.com/abalkin/pytest-leaks), mostly cleaned up by Pauli)
    - Some fixes for 1.17. release (above issue, although no solution)
    - Started writing NEPs (thinking about dtype classes/flexible types)
        - Will plan a zoom meeting beginning of next week.
