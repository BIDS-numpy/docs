# 2019-2-13 BIDS/NumPy Development Meeting

- Join via Zoom at [https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/400054438), or dial-in through a [local phone number](https://zoom.us/u/adQDmEc1wI).
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [NumPy at BIDS Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2lla2dwaWdtMjMyamJobGRzZmIyYzJqODFjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)

**Present:** Tyler, Matti, Stefan, Sebastien, Hameer, Chuck

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions

- SciPy 2019 [Conference Submissions](https://hackmd.io/bzbzioNFRIWfEdGCp3pAqQ) -- Deadline extended to Feb. 15th.
  - check the Tutorial outline -- probably too much stuff in some parts; Tyler added a bunch to build / testing section, but others should rebalance to other sections they want to teach
  - TODO: remove material from the schedule to get to 3 hours

## Community Suggested Topics

- Specifying dtypes. [This PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5634) suggests extending `a = np.array(b, min_dtype=np.float32)` but then moved on to more exotic dtype specification syntax:
  - np.array(b, dtype=np.blasable) for `(s, d, c, z)`
  - np.array(b, dtype=np.floating)

  and there are also proposals around to make the default never convert to an object array to avoid the `np.array([[1], [2, 2]])` problems. I used `np.array` but the same holds for `np.asarray` or `np.asanyarray` or ... (Matti)
  - Hameer suggests ordering the dtypes and adding casting rules. Would need a flag for abstract?
  - Can we do this as a table? A tree? A method on a dtype subclass?
  - Use cases: np.blasable, np.complex, np.no-object, np.inexcact (float, complex)
  - Julia casting tables for type promoting
  - Maybe use context managers to modify the casting rules?
  - Think about this in the context of overflow

- Import problem
- Merge timsort fix and then think about other solutions
- Call with Amazon / MXNet team & Ralf Gommers [this afternoon 3pm Pacific time](https://chime.aws/6722799723)

## Work status

Matti:
- Scipy submissions
- Fallout from [timsort merge](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12945). We broke quaternions and maybe other packages.
- Try to unstick dtype progress by writing another [dtype document](https://hackmd.io/ok21UoAQQmOtSVk6keaJhw?both#) thinking maybe github comments is no the forum to manage a discussion. But that didn't work either. Maybe we need to do a "dtype summit" over a weekend to get some of the higher level details discussed to progress could be made? Could it be virtual? I could come to the west coast for that?
  - TODO: Get all the documents together in one place, post it to the dev mailing list with a call to get reactions

Tyler:
- SciPy `1.2.1` has finally been released
  - `make dist` portability to different dev environments was a little problematic (esp. wrt to feedback when deps were missing)
  - doc upload to Enthought server was blocked due to permissions issue -- should now be resolved for my next release cycle
- SciPy manuscript: I'm working to get more believable Python / compiled line coverage results over project history, which is one of our Figures
  - see: https://github.com/tylerjereddy/scipy-cov-track
    - this is pretty painful to do---`runtests.py` features evolve over time and pytest / nose transition, and so on...
  - a little bit of community engagement on paper, but still not that much really
