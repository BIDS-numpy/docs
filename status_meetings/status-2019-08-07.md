# 2019-08-07 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Inessa, Tyler, Peter Entschev, ZJ Poh, Sebastian, Ralf, Chuck, Kriti, Matthew Brett


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Proposal for dropping older Python versions [NEP 29](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14086/files)
    - We need some data (Python 3.5 downloads).  Preliminary analysis at [this repo](https://github.com/matthew-brett/pypi-by-distro).  See results at end of [this notebook](https://github.com/matthew-brett/pypi-by-distro/blob/master/analyze_pypi_downloads.ipynb).
    - Maybe probably target things like Ubuntu LTS?
    - The people involved in the discussion are not those affected by it. (we may force users to Anaconda).
    - NEP could have options: Projects could decide how fast they move.

- Community building
    - A survey is planned. 
    - Season of Docs participants announced
- Website redesign PEP merged.
    - Added people to website Team on GitHub


# Topics

- Community Survey:
    - Engages the community.
    - What do we want to find out?
    - Database of Members (PyData has 100k members?)
    - Identifier Community: Background (Science, Teaching, Industry), potential contributor
    - Survey should be short and easy to process
    - Survey can be a two way communication, by introducing things
    - Offer to send a survey report (hopefully)
    - Inessa is going to put up a google doc to invite people to ask questions of what we want from the survey.

- Proposal for dropping older Python versions [NEP 29]
    - Get back to the NEP thread, suggest that some projects will choose to support 3 python versions (and numpy would be one of those)

- GSoD will host the project ["Making "The Basics" a Little More Basic: Improving the Introductory NumPy Sections"](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/project-numpy)
    - There will be a kick-off call, writing starts September.

- Duckarray [NEP](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/neps/nep-0030-duck-array-protocol.rst)
    - Expand the Motivation (potential users) a bit.

- Section in [HOWTO_RELEASE](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/releasing.html#make-the-release) about sourceforge: is it relevant?
    - Chuck will have a look at Matti's PR
    - We are not using Sourceforge any more.  Last Numpy upload there was [3 years ago](https://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/), for [Scipy, it was about 4 years ago](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/).

- Vendor towncrier?
    - Yes
    - Put things in to have working release.

- Releases upcoming 1.16.5 (1.17.1 still waiting for feedback):
    - Sebastian should help with it to get to know the release progress. (1.17.1)


## Additional Details

- Matti
    - Work on activating numpy/doc -> numpy.org/doc as the documentation archive instead of scipy.org/doc

- Sebastian
    - Draft starts: https://hackmd.io/kxuh15QGSjueEKft5SaMug, https://hackmd.io/y7ghitUtRQaMyaHFGe-ueQ
    - Towncrier
