  - TODO: [Jan 5] post to mailing list to discussion status of random
- OpenBLAS might need improvement in docs for MacOS, archlinux
- Ping intel about progress on the way they patch NumPy after the holidays: we cannot really deal with a soft-fork of NumPy,
  - how do Anaconda vet the code?
  - TODO: [Jan 5] Contact Intel again about functions that extend NumPy API

## Work status

Matti:
- Dtypes progress
  - [new pr](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12585)
  - TODO: finish the draft dtypes design document (Stephan Hoyer)
  - dtype is now type; next step would be to implement, e.g., categorical dtype that uses this
  - Catch up with work done by Pandas / Jeff Reback on types
- "Open Source" evening dev meeting Dec 19 [presentation](https://github.com/mattip/presentations/blob/master/ITC-open-source-dec-19.odp)
