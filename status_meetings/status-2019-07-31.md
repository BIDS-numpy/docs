- Time: 11am Pacific Time

- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Inessa, Matthew Brett, Sebastian, Chuck, Kriti


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions


- 1.17.0 released!
- Proposal for dropping older Python versions [NEP 29](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14086/files)
- Conversation with GitHub about mechanism for monitoring community health, improve project planning, etc.
    - A survey is planned.
- Community building/website


# Topics

- Implications from [policy on dropping Python versions](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14086)
    - We need some data (Python 3.5 downloads)
    - Maybe probably target things like Ubuntu LTS?
    - The people involved in the discussion are not those affected by it. (we may force users to Anaconda).
    - NEP could have options: Projects could decide how fast they move.
    - (We "force" users to update, since we put bug fixes in new releases only after a while, no LTS)
    - Invite others to this time slot next week. Matthew will look into data.
- Moving towncrier files (Sebastian)
    - upcoming folder in release notes?
    - Check with Jupyter what they are using. (Some use tool to scrape changelog, not necessarily release notes in our style, of course that could be an option, but its a somewhat different approach to towncrier)
- quantile method kwarg? (`statistics.quantiles`, note the plural uses one)
    - Philip Stark (at UC berkeley).
    - Maling list discussion will be needed.


## Additional Details

- Matti
    -  On Vacation

- Sebastian
    - Fixed up towncrier to be able to generate NumPy style release notes
    - Worked on/discussed dtypes.
    - tied up a bit by organizational things
