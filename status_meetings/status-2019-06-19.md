# 2019-06-19 NumPy Development Meeting

- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Sebastian, Matti, Chuck

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions
- Talk for SciPy2019
  - We need data to show how the grant has affected the project
    - Nelle responded to a private mail but has not yet provided data
  - Talk so far is in [the repo](https://gitlab.com/numpy/scipy2019-presentation-insidenumpy)---note that this is a private repo
  - Long term sustainability of development (and continued funded development) is on our mind; Tyler is heading back to Los Alamos end of this week
- 1.17 release upcoming: review PRs/Issues marked with [1.17 milestone](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/62). At last count there are 9 open issues and 5 open PRs with the milestone, maybe just start bumping issues at this point
  - [PR #13764](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13764) should be merged, moves windll code to a `_distributor_init.py` file when using OpenBlas on Windows
  - 4 of the PRs have to do with random, see below.

- Random generator work
    - How many BitGenerators to include: the general concensus is to include a minimum rather than a maximum, and to use PCG64 as the default. Matti will submitted PRs to implement this decision. 
      - Create bitgenerator repo for the moment.
- PR for SeedSequence as a way to seed the BitGenerators
    - Would it help for the full-time devs to submit a PR to randomgen to update it for the changes:
      - Base class for BitGenerator
      - SeedSequence

- 1.18 plans: If it is a "settle down" release, how do we approach larger code changes i.e. for dtypes?

## Topics


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - The windll change began a push to move OpenBLAS handling to a central pytohn-based file rather than have each CI system in MacPython/numpy-wheels have its own solution. Still thinking about how to do this cleanly.
  - Gave a talk at a community college's computer engineering seminar about open source, python, jupyter.
  - Figured out how to link to cpython documentation in sphinx: `:ref:c:member:PyTypeObject.tp_as_number`

- Sebastian
    - Mocked up a possible approach for dtypes at: https://github.com/seberg/numpy_dtype_prototype
    - Maybe present it at a BOF session at SciPy (Chuck)?

- Hameer
    - PR for NEP Template: [#13766](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13766).
        - Looking for feedback.
