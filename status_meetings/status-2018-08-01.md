# Status 1-Aug-2018

## Dtypes
  - Tyler started early effort on np.naint64 for missing integer support dtype in his NumPy fork branch named `naint64`; see [workflowy notes](https://workflowy.com/s/DdCP.SkHUHzK15B); added around 38 unit tests to "describe" behavior
  - Matti notes that Tyler can check out the integer dtype inheritence graph for NumPy and in general the [dtype documentation](http://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.dtypes.html?highlight=dtypes)
  - Matti noted that Tyler could also perhaps check pandas missing value behavior a bit more
  - should also implement all the ufuncs
  - should not implement casting 
  - supporting multiple views that separately mask the original naint64 array seems like a pretty challening thing
  - Tyler is currently proposing to bake the experimental dtype directly into the NumPy source as an exercise, but Matti may try to do a "third party" dtype implementation in the spirit of the recent datetime and quaternion implementations in the wild

## nep 15
  - positive reviews from core devs; looks likely to be merged (Tyler reviewed this as well)

## adding C line coverage to codecov report
[PR 11610](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11610)
- Close to working, but there is a [linker error](https://travis-ci.org/numpy/numpy/jobs/410559252)
- Iteration times are slow for Tyler and hard on CI resources -- maybe can try running Travis container locally??
- codecov failure should fail the ci check, rather it should be available for devs to see as part of review. see [PR 11662](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11662)
## matmul as ufunc
  - [PR 11133](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11133) works using BLAS. It is stalled because NEP 20 (PR #11175) was approved but review is stuck.
     - Tyler should review this for learning, etc., and perhaps to revitalize if stuff is stagnating

## triaging
 Filter issues with no labels with [is:open is:issue no:label ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Alabel) there are over 750 in this status
