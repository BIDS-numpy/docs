# 2019-08-28 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Matti, Stefan, Tyler, Hameer, Inessa, Warren, Ralf, Sebastian, ZJ

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions
- Move multibuild to MacPython and change its name
  Matti is now a maintainer on the multibuild repo
  - move numpy-wheels to the numpy organization
  - move wheel builds [to azure from appveyor](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/60)
    Stopped work on this until after the current release cycle

- 1.17.1 and 1.16.5 released!! Documentation at https://numpy.org/doc not updated yet.

- Add a ci-tests-requirements.txt and use it in the CI system. [Working PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14378). Needs a bit of guidance

- Possible NumPy developer weekend: Nov 22-23 maybe move it back to the weekdays before that? Some of the documentation team may join.

- Inaugural NumPy Community Survey (see section below for details)
  - translation to other languages: Zj Poh volunteered.

# Topics

- Refresh the admins of the github [numpy organization admins](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/teams/owners-legacy)
- Rackspace [wheels](https://7933911d6844c6c53a7d-47bd50c35cd79bd838daf386af554a83.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/) and [openblas](https://3f23b170c54c2533c070-1c8a9b3114517dc5fe17b7c3f8c63a43.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/) uploads.
  - Matthew Brett has the unencrypted key. Does anyone else?
    - Should be part of the private repo for NumPy management.
  - we should upload arm and powerpc OpenBLAS to there as well (currently on DroBox since Tyler builds them)

- our [information at nabble](http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/) is outdated. The [admins](http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/template/NamlServlet.jtp?macro=app_people&node=2&filter=Administrators) can change it, does anyone know who Timmie and Israel are?
    - Maybe try the "send email to" link on their user pages (mattip tried that, "Timmie" seems to be Tim Michelsen?, could not get info on "Israel")?

- Private vs. public submodules in namespace, we're continuing to just add random public-looking things, it's a bit of a mess. What do we do?
    - For `numpy.random` see e.g. [gh-14360](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14360)
    - Another example: `dir(np.lib.mixins)`
    - We should add a test that hardcodes the current namespace, and will fail if anything is added without a PR.
    - Polynomial namespace, multiple ways of calling the poly functions; Eric Wieser has a [suggestion](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13601#issuecomment-525591808) on how to fix

- Open PRs, waiting for review/merge:
  - ship our own [numpy.pxd](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12284)
  - [use a release summary instead of a wall of text](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13886)

- Nep [website](https://numpy.org/neps) not updating from [repo](https://github.com/numpy/neps), Nep 29 not appearing
  - NEP 30 is showing up, so something is broken with NEP 29?

- Hameer proposed NEP 31: [Context-local and global overrides of the NumPy API](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14389/files)


### Inaugural NumPy Community Survey
GitHub repo: github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys

Proposal
github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys/blob/master/NumPy-survey-proposal.md

Topics Overview
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys/blob/master/NumPy-survey-topics.md

Questionnaire Draft
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys/blob/master/NumPy-survey-questionnaire.md

This survey shall have up to 40 questions, mainly close-ended to allow easy processing, and take 5-10 minutes to complete.

All NumPy community members are invited to contribute to the creation and selection of questions by submitting pull requests against the [`numpy-surveys` repo](github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys).

## Additional Details

- Matti
  - [cython `@property` decorator](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3095), seems to work but needs a refactor
  - reviving dtype allocation and initialization changes in preparation for Sebastian's larger refactoring
  - preparing a [talk](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/blob/scipy-europe-2019/presentations/inside_numpy_talk_scipy2019.pptx) for EuroSciPy Sept 5 based on Ralf's SciPy talk and a ctypes, cffi, Cython [tutorial](https://github.com/mattip/c_from_python)

- Sebastian
    - [Extensible Datatypes for NumPy](https://hackmd.io/kxuh15QGSjueEKft5SaMug) is pretty far along (good to read through, details probably missing, but some of them might still be in flux). Start to change the basics in NumPy: https://github.com/seberg/numpy/tree/dtypemeta (alpha, trying a few different approaches). Inserting dtype classes works.
        - Next step: wrapping new slots with legacy compatible versions (implement a basic CastingImpl).
        - Redirect current API functions to use new slots (old API functions may be renamed and used as fallbacks for compatibility slot implementations).
    - Slight issue: ABI compatibility of ``PyArray_DescrCheck``, but we can backport a fix to old numpy versions (So compiling with an updated old version of numpy would work).
    - Got lost in Dynamically created Type Objects, so for now "malloc" them and use the typical "static" python API (this seems OK for legacy wrapping, but not ideal?).

- Warren
    - Old pull request triage: closed some abandoned PRs, pinged devs on others., push for close or complete.
    - Bug fix for histogram.
    - Restarted conversation about deprecating the financial functions.
    - Updated PR for the multivariate hypergeometric distribution, waiting for review.
    - Started reviewing ufunc code, and worked on improving the internal code documentation in generate_umath.py.
    - Catch up on Sebastian's NEP / dtype work
