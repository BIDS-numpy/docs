# 2019-09-11 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** ZJ, Tyler, Warren, Chuck, Hameer, Ralf, Matti, Sebastian, Inessa, St√©fan

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Ralf opened [PR 14454](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14454) to document the public API. Do we need to discuss it?
  - Polynomial namespace, multiple ways of calling the poly functions; Eric Wieser has a [suggestion](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13601#issuecomment-525591808) on how to fix
  - TODO Follow up on surveying new public API surface in `np.random` (Matti will try and clean that up)

# Topics

- NEP repo updates github.com/numpy/neps do not reflect to https://numpy.org/neps
  - Github deploy is not triggered (reliably?) for some reason
  - Sebastian asked support for help
- In discussing build warnings, @rgommers raised the following ideas:
  - hide the _configtest output by default. we regularly get issues about those where people see lots of errors and for example hit Ctrl-C
    - add a `--debug-config` option to show this output?
  - introduce a CI run that's clean with the latest GCC. we have a `-Werror` build somewhere, but only with old GCC (existing build matrix entry could be updated)
  - introduce a CI run that's clean on macOS with Clang (lots of warnings right now)
    - clang on linux too?
- Hypothesis in testing. The mailing list discussion was very short. [PR 14440](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14440) is an example for discussion
  - Ask for some more examples, especially around bytestrings/unicode, pickling. Don't pin the version.
- [NEP 32](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0032-remove-financial-functions.html): So far, there have been only a few responses to the announcements on the numpy-discussion and pydata mailing lists.
    - Well before the release of 1.18 we will have a numpy-financial package on PyPI and deprecation stubs in numpy.
- NEP 31
    - Add `determine_backend`:
        - Few choices: `__ua_domain__` or making `__ua_convert__` mandatory.
    - Any additional comments?
  - The general feeling is that we need to get the correct people on a high-bandwidth discussion. Perhaps at the Nov 22-23 meeting? 
- Social media channels - reserving for now?
  - Maybe trademark the NumPy name?
- Website redesign update
  - Ralf, Inessa showed off the new site.
- Logo refresh is going on [numpy.org PR 36](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/37)


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - Participated in EuroSciPy. It was nice to meet up with folks. A number of people sprinted, among them we got a PR to use hypothesis in our testing.
  - Pushed some small changes to Cython, trying to help them get 3.0 out. Also a small fix for the `@property` decorator in numpy.pxd in SciPy.
  - Adding a new dtype via (ab)use of the object dtype for geodata in pandas
 
- Sebastian
    - [Extensible Datatypes for NumPy](https://hackmd.io/kxuh15QGSjueEKft5SaMug) Matti had some feedback/clarifications.
    - Started (prototyping): https://github.com/seberg/numpy/pull/6
        - Start on `PyArray_InitDTypeMetaFromSpec(...)`
        - Not quite there yet for AbstractDType for value based casting, but next step.

- Warren
  - Repo for my experiments with custom dtypes using the current API is https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numtypes
  - Spent time on this issue in numpy.random:
    - Bug report: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14457
    - Initial fix by ahaldane: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14458
    - My follow-up PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14465
