# 2019-07-17 NumPy Development Meeting

- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Matti, St√©fan, Inessa (web site redesign), Dashamir (GSOD applicant), Ralf, Sebastian, Chuck


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [Issue 13707](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13707) to use towncrier or other release notes mechanism
  - requires use of pyproject.toml, is that OK?
  - Alternatively push `towncrier.toml` usage upstream? (Sebastian will look into towncrier)
  - TODO: Decision is to do both: accept the PR and ask for them to fix it
    (Ralf suggests to split up the PR üëç), we shoul do this fairly soon to allow merging
    piling up PRs needing release notes.

# Topics

- Redo project organization, spell out more roles we have. See PR [gh-14027](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14027).
- Website redesign NEP - translations. See also mailing list threads:
    - (https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2019-July/079838.html)
    - (https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2019-July/079856.html)
  - TODO: make a "web team" for work on this (action Ralf).
  - What about graphics on the website? 
    This would be very nice. Step 1 is to generate some relevant content and migrate to Hugo/Jekyll (preference for Hugo in this call). Step 2 could be to involve a graphic/UX designer and make the site look really good (e.g. compare jupyter.org). 
  - We have quite a few volunteers: Joe, Inessa, Dashamir, Shekhar. 
- Use cython for interface code (e.g. micro optimization is simpler)
    - Does seem like it makes Interface code simpler/easier to maintain.
    - Redo Pull request with Cython (may be a major restructuring though, Stephan Hoyer may have insights).
    - Mail to the mailing list and try it.
- Documentation archive migration to numpy.org/doc
  - Needs [PR 13990](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13990) to fix `make dist`
  - Then a subsequent PR will change `make release` or add a new make target to update the [numpy/doc repo](https://github.com/numpy/doc) with the latest documentation when a new release is made
  - Ralf expressed concern that the repo will grow too large to deal with
    - `make release` command will clone the repo
    - github pages has a soft 1GB limit and a hard 100GB limit
    - Currently the repo, with 1.17, 1.16, 1.15, 1.14 maintainence HEAD documentation, is a 77MB download and a total of 291MB disk space.
- Accuracy of [complex `expm1`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14019). SciPy does not have this bug. Where is SciPy's implementation? I found [scipy/special/cephes](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/v1.3.0/scipy/special/cephes) but did not find the complex math functions
    - grep cexp1

- Prominently noting contributors, historical and present (note for website redesign)
- History of NumPy
    - [SciPy paper](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-articles/tree/master/scipy-1.0) may be a good start on which we can expand

## Additional Details
We spent much of the past two weeks preparing for and at Scipy. We met with many people, and I think the "vibe" around NumPy is positive. It seems there are more first-timers filing issues and pull requests, around corner cases and documentation.
- Matti
  I am going on vacation for 2 1/2 weeks starting Saturday. 
- Sebastian
