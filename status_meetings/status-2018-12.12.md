**Present:** Matti, Tyler, St√©fan, Sebastian, Hameer

## Follow-up from last meeting

- blog post from dev meeting - draft is [here](https://hackmd.io/yE21K--tTaKzwOF5ZUJLQQ)
- TODOs from dev weekend [numpy.org developer](https://trello.com/c/vpEXo4CO), [Lenore Mullin](https://trello.com/c/0actiEOb), [PowerPC](https://trello.com/c/Bj9IvwgP), [CZI and type annotations](https://trello.com/c/iLAPF9yB)
- SciPy manuscript
- SciPy release process updating (? Tyler can update docs a little maybe after the release, pending review, but most improvements will be longer-term workflow adjustments and reduced dissonance between dev CI and wheels CI)

## Community Suggested Topics

- [Mailing list email](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-December/079042.html) from Lars G. re: `numpy.pad` rewrite? [PR #11358](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11358)
    - Would help to first merge a thorough test suite; suggest this split on the PR
    - Sebastian will give some feedback on the PR next week
    - why is there no coverage % report on this PR?
- radix-sort should be default in NumPy? [Hameer]
    - Uses some temporary memory of O(N), so not in-place, but still quite a bit faster
    - timsort is somewhere in between
    - radix-sort is not implemented at all
        - currently introsort when you request quicksort; good, but not stable sort.
    - mergesort is stable, but slower; so radix-sort can provide a stable + fast sort
    - First step: implement radix-sort as an option in NumPy
        - Hameer needs some assistance to fully implement radix-sort (allocating temporary memory)
        - Matti will give a hand, if Hameer sets up an outline implementation

## Work status

Matti:
- Short summary of two-day performance summit in Seattle
    - Topics: Industry input, JIT, Packaging and distribution
    - Quarterly meetings planned
    - Travis & Nathaniel both presented their visions for NumPy: N on an intermediate representation that can be compiled; T on a full rewrite (as explored in libxnd etc.)
    - Victor Stinner is now 100% time on CPython, sponsored by RedHat, pushing C-API refactor 
- Dtypes progress
  - [activity](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12518) about ufunc redesign
  - [make more functions ufuncs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12514) [clip](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12519) [argmax, argmin](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12516), [argsort, sort](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12516)
  - TODO: finish the draft dtypes design document (Stephan Hoyer)
- Triaging bugs for 1.16 release
- "Open Source" presentation Monday, a evening dev meeting Dec 19; how to be a good consumer, and a good contributor
    - [presentation](https://github.com/mattip/presentations/blob/master/ITC-tech-fellows-dec-10.odp)
    - Presented at the [Israel Tech Challenge](https://www.itc.tech/fellows-data-science/)'s data track 

Tyler:

- [adding refguide check](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12253) to NumPy remains a major task that can be slowly chipped away at; generally, new docstring failures after rebasing will be marked with SKIPs and an issue opened to avoid excessive burden there; lots of issues to work on here; adding more functions to `__all__` and more public submodules so their docstrings are executed (also, the docs for refguide are basically--read the module / docstring)
  - the fact that vanilla doctest was used to generate the initial superset of changes before switching over to refguide is going to continue to cause some confusion, and also some of the adjusted docs are no longer executed under refguide, at least until some expansions noted above are performed
  - refguide (docstring testing in general?) requires rebuilding NumPy to pick up the new docstrings
- SciPy `1.2.0` may be released soon-ish, currently on `1.2.0rc2`; the process has proved quite time consuming so far
- plenty of testing / infrastructure issues & projects for NumPy & SciPy, including improved openblas backend usage on Azure, and [WIP](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12523) to provide NumPy with run-time access to the openblas version string (provides post-mortem assurance, etc.)
    - Note: we now have OpenBLAS version info available at run-time!
- `timedelta64` `floordiv` [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12308) is probably ready to go; precursor to divmod
