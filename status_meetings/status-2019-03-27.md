# 2019-3-27 BIDS/NumPy Development Meeting

**Present:** Tyler, Matti, Stefan, Hameer, Sebastian, Ralf, 

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
- Our SciPy 2019 Tutorial proposals were rejected & Tyler's LDRD preproposal was also rejected :(
- Documentation now errors on warnings
- randomgen [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13163) and [tracking issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13164)
  - repo merged, passes tests as a mtrand replacement
  - need to stil merge docs, benchmark, fix TODOs
  - should we reduce the git history to a few commits? which ones?
 
## Community Suggested Topics

- Idea for a new NEP: have a verbose or safe mode for NumPy (mattip)
  - would warn on integer overflow
  - would warn on writing to an array with overlap (activate `NPY_WARN_ON_WRITE` flag when setting strides with overlap) motivated by [broadcast_array PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12609)
  - maybe more warnings for outdated API calls?
  - RECOMMENDATION: only repurpose `NPY_WARN_ON_WRITE` for `broadcast_array`. 
- merging numpy.org [pr](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/pull/17) (mattip)

## Work status

Matti:
- randomgen
  - [documentation](https://bashtage.github.io/randomgen) is built differently, with a nice template BTW. Numpy organizes everything in one directory with periods to indicate packages: `routines.polynomials.laguerre.rst` but `routines.random.randomgen.brng.philox.rst` is unweildy. The original randomgen documentation is organized into directories `random/brng/philox.rst`. Also, gettting autosummary to work properly is taking time.
- Outreachy
  - Lots of applicants, so far no real PRs.
- [Vendor numpy.pxd](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12284) PR - hit an [issue in cython](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2905), waiting for confirmation that it is truly a cython issue

Tyler:
- Bug Fix Efforts
  - NumPy
    - [(open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13168) improve `datetime64` repr span symmetry: there's an approving review from Stephan Hoyer but Eric points out some weaknesses; datetime programming without a reliable testing framework for span limits is **insane**; I need *gold standard* references for datetime span limit results
      - perhaps the best course of action for now is to transplant my unit tests into [Eric's alternative PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13188)
    - [(open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13061) prohibit int / bool -> `m8` casting:
      - I've confirmed that this **does** break `pandas` master branch datetime handling
      - [(merged: pandas)](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/25826) PR with minimal fixes needed to get pandas master branch tests to pass--*very positive reception*--they should be able to rip out a bunch of code because of the new `m8` features too
      - NumPy test suite for datetime is too weak to catch even fairly major breakage :/
- DevOps Efforts
  - `mingwpy`: I have a "green light" from Carl now---step 1: work on CI, which matches my current ecosystem efforts anyway
    - we want either mingwpy or flang merged upstream; sustainability concerns (mingw64 -- Ray Donnelly?; upstream for flang-windows is mainstream flang)
    - action: Tyler should progressively probe Carl until he has the knowledge needed to help sustainability
  - NumPy
    - [(merged)](https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs/pull/1) PR to build latest OpenBLAS release for "MacPython ecosystem" availability; follow-ups:
      - [(open)](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/44) Bump the `numpy-wheels` OpenBLAS to `v0.3.5` because of OpenBLAS-related NumPy [issue fixed in release](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13173)
      - [(open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12790) Bumped from `v0.3.5.dev` to `0.3.5` to see how version detection machinery handles an actual `OpenBLAS` version upgrade in the wild
    - [OpenBLAS with gcc runtime static link](https://github.com/tylerjereddy/openblas-static-gcc):
      - **MacOS**: there's an [open PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13191) to NumPy clearly demonstrating removal of runtime dependence on `libgfortran` and `libquadmath` for the `OpenBLAS` `dylib`--- are we in favor of doing this for the MacPython builds proper? Removes our chaining to specific `gfortran` lib versions
      - **Windows**: I've built OpenBLAS locally in msys2 Windows env; Windows uses the `openblas.a` in dev CI at the moment, it seems, so this is slightly more confusing, unless we think about the (still unmerged) DLL-dependent OpenBLAS version detection code
          - next step maybe: demonstrate Windows OpenBLAS DLL can be opened via ctypes with no supporting mingw64 toolchain libs on PATH?
          - confusing to think about: OpenBLAS DLL vs. the "built" DLL that shows up in `.libs`
      - **Linux**: I could probably do something similar to MacOS above, but let's get consensus on that platform first before I expand effort
