# 2019-05-22 NumPy Development Meeting

- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Stéfan, Tyler, Matti, Kriti, Sebastian, Chuck


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

## Topics
- Merging [randomgen](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13163)
  - Sebastian will try to take a look
- What to do with `__array_function__`?
    - Sebastian will try to write a short summary for the mailing list.
    - For now seems like it `__skip_array_function__` will not happen in 1.17.
- Outreachy has begun - welcome Kriti!
- Problem with NEP website - [repo](https://github.com/numpy/neps) is updating but [website](http://www.numpy.org/neps/) shows old content
    - Stéfan will take a look (pushed an empty commit up and the page updated; not sure about cause of problem, but could be [this GitHub incident](https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/6vyp7d36str6)).

- Deprecations https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11521

## Additional Details

- Tyler -- [weekly working notes](https://workflowy.com/s/may-22-2019/vi9KHqf6tZOSkGu0) 

- Matti
  - randomgen: refactor, rebase, squash. Removed pieces that are not up to production or have licensing issues. Ready for merge.
  - start work on [talk](https://hackmd.io/p/Sy4cT6MTN#/) for [PyCon IL](https://cfp.pycon.org.il/conference/talk/ZPQDHC/) and workshop on [wrapping C code](https://cfp.pycon.org.il/workshops/talk/3GB9DL/)
  - helping Ralf to mentor GSOD

- Sebastian
    - Continued with `ufunc_impl` work:
        - Implemented `np.add` for `S` dtype (this could probably be added to current numpy even, although discovery of correct output may not be pretty.)
        - Could actually implement a "unit" metadata which would be handled correctly (no reductions).
        - Need to entagle it fully
        - Need to figure out how to handle value based casting (probably early on)
    - Some PRs/Issue triaging
