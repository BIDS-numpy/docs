# 2019-09-04 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Inessa, Tyler, Warren, ZJ, Chuck, Hameer, Matti, St√©fan, Ralf, Sebastian, Peter Bell


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions
- Move multibuild to MacPython and change its name (postpone until November)
  - move numpy-wheels to the numpy organization
  - move wheel builds [to azure from appveyor](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/60)
    Stopped work on this until after the current release cycle
    Nothing has changed since last week

- 1.17.1 and 1.16.5 released!! Documentation at https://numpy.org/doc not updated yet.

- NumPy developer weekend: Nov 22-23. Some of the documentation team may join, we should publish the dates. Tentative agenda [here](https://hackmd.io/t06nCEAfSJ6DhPnkhlUDRg)
    - Also invite documentation writers that are nearby

- NumPy Community Survey
Volunteers for translations:
Hindi  - Pankaj Jangid 
Chinese - ZJ Poh
Spanish - ?
Portuguese - ?
<i>(Contact Inessa if you would like to help.)</i>

All NumPy community members are invited to contribute to the creation and selection of questions by submitting pull requests to github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys.


# Topics

- Refresh the admins of the github [numpy organization admins](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/teams/owners-legacy)
- Rackspace [wheels](https://7933911d6844c6c53a7d-47bd50c35cd79bd838daf386af554a83.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/) and [openblas](https://3f23b170c54c2533c070-1c8a9b3114517dc5fe17b7c3f8c63a43.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/) uploads.
  - Matthew Brett has the unencrypted key. Does anyone else?
    - Should be part of the private repo for NumPy management.
  - we should upload arm and powerpc OpenBLAS to there as well (currently on DroBox since Tyler builds them)
- TODO Document ownership of keys in https://gitlab.com/numpy/logistics

- Our [information at nabble](http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/) is outdated. They asked for names of new admins. Who should we submit? All the steering committee?
  - Put on Chuck, Ralf, Matti, Sebastian, Stefan

- Private vs. public submodules in namespace, we're continuing to just add random public-looking things, it's a bit of a mess. What do we do?
    - For `numpy.random` see e.g. [gh-14360](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14360)
    - Another example: `dir(np.lib.mixins)`
    - We should add a test that hardcodes the current namespace, and will fail if anything is added without a PR.
    - Polynomial namespace, multiple ways of calling the poly functions; Eric Wieser has a [suggestion](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13601#issuecomment-525591808) on how to fix
- TODO Follow up on surveying new public API surface in `np.random`

- Open PRs, waiting for review/merge:
  - [NEP-31](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14389), should be merged quickly as per NEP-0
    - TODO Add a sentence to NEP0 to walk back slightly the highly optimistic merge policy (we will still merge rejected NEPs, but then with the rejected status already in place)

- NEP 31, for those who have read it. (Hameer)
    - NEP for `uarray`: [PR#14389](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14389), [mailing list thread](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2019-September/079961.html).
    - Should we change the submodule? I feel since NumPy is not deeply nested, `numpy.overridable` is enough. Vendor or move to `numpy` org?
    - Should we change the name? `numpy.unumpy` would also be good, although a bit of a tongue twister.
    - Any other suggestions/discussion?

- [*NEP 32: Remove the financial functions from NumPy*](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14399) has been announced on the mailing list. 

## Additional Details

- Matti
  - gave a tutorial on wrapping C code at EuroScipy. Participated today in discussions on [diversity](https://hackmd.io/hLbQbLckTUal-XopUJ303Q?both) and sustainability 
- Sebastian
    - [Extensible Datatypes for NumPy](https://hackmd.io/kxuh15QGSjueEKft5SaMug)
    - Started (prototyping): https://github.com/seberg/numpy/pull/6

- Warren
  - Wrote "NEP 32: Remove the financial functions from NumPy" and announced it on the mailing list.
  - Learning C API for Python and NumPy custom dtypes:
    - Created a Python object in C as an exercise: "nannable" int32.
    - Working on making this into a custom NumPy dtype.
