# 2019-07-03 NumPy Development Meeting

- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** St√©fan, Matti, Hameer, Sebastian, Chuck


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Talk for SciPy2019
  Sebastian made some plots with the data from Nelle. Now we need to improve the story around the text.
  - Talk so far is in [the repo](https://gitlab.com/numpy/scipy2019-presentation-insidenumpy)---note that this is a private repo

- 1.17 released
  A bit of fallout around np.min, Dask and `__array_function__`.
    - need documentation around best-practices in implementing `__array_function__` and `__array_ufunc__`
    - Maybe we should catch Stefan Hoyer at SciPy to move documentation forward.
    - (comment Ralf): I think that's the easy part, what to do about, e.g., `np.median(dask_array)` is trickier.
    - Small issue with `np.i0`
      - Deprecate the public version
      - Fixup the current version to not break pandas.

- [Issue 13707](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13707) to use towncrier or other release notes mechanism
  Matplotlib's [PR to use towncrier](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14589)
    
# Topics

- [PR 13516](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13516) to add low-level simd optimizations (mattip)
  How will we review this? It seems like a lot of code, is it ported from somewhere else? Perhaps we need a set of tests to confirm our math operations are accurate ([issue 13515](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13515))
- `numpy.core.function_base` and `numpy.lib.function_base`: are both really needed?
    - (comment Ralf, since I may not make this meeting): I consider both private. We don't have a proper public/private split in NumPy. I would suggest not to tackle such issues piecemeal, but rather at some point sit down and really figure out and document what the public submodules are.
- [error message in ragged array creation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6584) has many upvotes. Should we try to improve it? 
  On the one hand, it is one of the most upvoted issues and [ranks high](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bnumpy%5D+error&tab=votes) on StackOverflow. 
  On the other hand, that means the solution to the error is very discoverable.
  - Probably the easiest fix is to make a longer error message that covers the two common cases (keep old message so it remains searchable; add text below)

- Rendering release notes for emails and github
  - prefer to have just a link. But then we need a home for the rendered branch release notes in real-time, not on scipy.org/numpy which is maintained by hand.
  - conclusion: that is OK, we should do it. We already have a script in the tools directory to do it, just need to point to a subdirectory
  - also once we have moved the canonical documentation we should change the scipy.org style to add a text notice or even a redirect.

## Additional Details

- Matti
  (missed last week's meeting)
  - Polishing 1.17 release notes and random
  - discussions with Sebastian around Scipy presentations and dtypes
- Sebastian
  - Reference count cleanup (including cython and getting pytest-leaks to run), should allow downstream to also refcheck their code.
  - Looking into plots for SciPy talk
