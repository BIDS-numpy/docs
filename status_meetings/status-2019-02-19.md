**Present:** Stefan, Tyler, Chuck, Sebastian, Matti, Hameer

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions

- SciPy 2019 proposals were submitted, thanks for the work
- Import problem: it seems anaconda broke changing `os.environ["PATH"]` on windows. There is ongoing discussion with Microsoft people what the best general approach should be [for python](https://bugs.python.org/issue35688) and the Anaconda people [will suggest](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/10628) a PR for us based on `AddDllDirectories`. There are many numpy issues around this, like [12977](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12977)
  - choices: 
    - wait until the dust on Anaconda's issue
    - Proactively change our build 
      - statically link and write a test that ->fails like Anaconda<- ??? and just check that the wheel has only one dll
      - change site.cfg or whatever we need to do to update
      - change our wheel layout to have `extra_dll_lib` point to the `numpy/core` directory rather than `numpy/.lib`
  - Conclusion: put it (`openblas.dll`) in the same directory with core {Tyler try this?}
- Chuck's fix to timsort was merged, now we can move on to radix sort
    - Benchmark PR is ready for review/merge (#12968).
    - How will we handle extending the list of available methods? - By deprecating the old API and moving to an API that allocates the struct.
- How was the call with the MXNet team & Ralf Gommers?

- TODO: deprecate the APIs that fix the structure size for sorting and dtype functions.

## Community Suggested Topics

- We need to [make a decision](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12979) about the `shlex` replacements of `exec_command()` in `distutils` (Tyler & Eric)
```python
>> flags = '-I/fake/directory "-I/path with/spaces" -Os'
>>> shlex.split(flags, posix=False)
['-I/fake/directory', '"-I/path with/spaces"', '-Os']
>>> shell_split(flags)
['-I\\fake\\directory', '-I/path with/spaces', '-Os']
```
One [issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12659) is on linux but they solved their problem differently
  - Just require posix-escaping everywhere---will break some paths on Windows
  - Implement our own version of shlex.split that works correctly on windows.
- Internship: Outreachy
    - Last day to add communities, 5 March.  Sooner is better, however, in terms of getting good students.

## Work status

Matti:
- Try to unstick dtype progress by writing another [dtype document](https://hackmd.io/ok21UoAQQmOtSVk6keaJhw?both#) thinking maybe github comments is no the forum to manage a discussion. But that didn't work either. Maybe we need to do a "dtype summit" over a weekend to get some of the higher level details discussed to progress could be made? Could it be virtual? I could come to the west coast for that?
  - TODO: Get all the documents together in one place, post it to the dev mailing list with a call to get reactions
  - Eric: some more ideas WIP at [yet another document](https://hackmd.io/s/ryTFaOPHE)
  - TODO: Send Eric's document out to the mailing list
- Try to get sphinx to **not** autodocument the ctypes attribute on subclasses of ndarray, see the [many repititions](http://www.numpy.org/devdocs/search.html?q=_ctypes.data) due to the [docstring](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.16.1/numpy/core/_add_newdocs.py#L2034)

Tyler:
- SciPy manuscript (`> 64 %` for my checklist): 
  - I've had some success improving our historical record for Python & compiled languages test coverage; Matt & CJ have chipped in some interesting visualizations for this
  - engagement from team has been a little better lately; I'm perhaps a little concerned about our lack of timeline / deadline---prose can always be better---when will things be good enough?
