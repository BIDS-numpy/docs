- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [NumPy at BIDS Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2lla2dwaWdtMjMyamJobGRzZmIyYzJqODFjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)

**Present:** Tyler, Chuck, Matti, Stefan, Oleksandr, Raghuveer, Sebastian

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions
- [timsort sort](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12418/) 
        - Should add to ASV benchmarks [Hameer will take this on]
    - Need to extend the benchmark suite for the explicit sorting names
    - Which should be the default sorting algorithm?
      - conclusion: change stablesort to point to timsort ; default remains quicksort (see [`kind` keyword](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html))
- Discuss web hosting situation with NumPy steering council [Stéfan]
  - We may exceed the bandwith limits of github. We might need a cloudflare or equivalent caching service. Pro: we would control the process. Con: it is nice that EnThought handles all the problems
  - Decision: put the 1.16 docs on github pages (numpy.org), set up cloudflare and point scipy.org to numpy.org on github pages. Stéfan will check back in with steering council one more time before proceeding.


## Community Suggested Topics
- [issue 12825](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12825) ndarrays pickled with 1.16 cannot be opened with 1.15.4 and earlier (mattip)
  - Matti will open an issue/PR
- [sphinx warnings](https://circleci.com/gh/numpy/numpy/5751?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link) for subclasses of ndarray while collecting autosummary (about half way down the `build devdocs` tab) (mattip)
  -  ask on numpydocs
- PyCon 2019 May 1-9 in Cleveland: Does NumFocus make an appearance there? Should we? (mattip)
    - If any community member has a specific, concrete idea of something we should pursue at PyCon, we would be happy to support them.
- SIMD vectorized sine and cosine (raghuveer)
  - If there is a open source version we could use, it would be accepted
- We still are using 4.8 for wheels, and seeing issues with sporadic i386 failures (could we explore bumping the gcc compiler toolchain version for our wheel builds / openblas as well?); need caution for gfortran version I think?
- How complicated is it to implement bfloat16 (extended exponent, shrunk mantissa)?
    - Currently quite hard to add new dtypes, hence the dtype work underway
    - There are a couple of packages outside of NumPy that does this ([quaternions](https://github.com/moble/quaternion ), [unyt](https://unyt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)—although the latter extends ndarrays)
    - More efficient linear algebra libraries implemented for bfloats; idea would be to pass ndarrays directly into these
    - Benefits of having it inside / outside of NumPy; no objection to including it *in principle*

## Work status

Matti:
- More work on pip and 1.16, [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12763) to detect a bad c-extension module. It also comes with a test, would be nice to merge it as protection from future issues like this
- Documentation cleanup to get a doc build with no warnings
- Dtype work has stalled, waiting for reactions to the NEP (Martin, Eric?).
- Closing issues (properties for ..., <matti>)
- Cython (see previous report)

Tyler:
- working on SciPy manuscript -- see [checklist](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-articles/issues/65) [22/74]
  - some comments from Matt Haberland & CJ Carey to consider
  - Anne Archibald would be a great person to ask to review it; maybe also Jake vDP?
